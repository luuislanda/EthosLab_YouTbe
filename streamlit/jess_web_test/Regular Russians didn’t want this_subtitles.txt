hello from russia my friends
i'm staying in saint petersburg city the
second biggest and the most beautiful
city in russia
and just casually walking i want to
share what's going on here these days
in saint petersburg
for the ones who don't know me my name
is nikki
i am russian i was born in siberia and
apparently now i live in the city of
saint petersburg which is really
beautiful place
i live here and
yesterday i was going to the city center
just to walk the streets i wanted to
live stream on my tiktok channel
and apparently
i and my friends were
going right in the middle of the protest
um a lot of people were protesting
petersburg the stimulus war
subway station
and uh
my friends and i we spend there for
about two hours with staying
there talking to people seeing what's
going on
and
i just thought it's
worthy and it's nice to share
what do
people in russia
feel what do i personally feel about the
recent events
because
last two days
it's just crazy
i literally woke up yesterday about 10
am
and the first thing i did is i received
a message from my follower from
philippines
he was asking me like how how how am i
doing how do i feel and i replied like
everything is fine i just woke up i'm
going to have a cup of coffee or
something like that
then i turned off my phone
i woke up i read the book i made
something uh i made myself a dream and
then i opened a laptop and read news
about russia starting the invasion
of ukraine
and i was like
yes
that's what we say in russia when
something bad and terrible is happening
so basically i didn't expect
to see
such kind of huge conflict between
russia and ukraine i didn't expect the
war to be started and to be started by
my own country which is a terrible thing
um
in the afternoon i thought
i just can't stay home
can't concentrate on working can
concentrate on studying so i perhaps
just go and walk the streets
perhaps live stream for my audience on
tick tock
and
then
i right bumped how do you say that in
english i write faced the people who
were going to the protest
it was happening a few kilometers away
from the place i'm staying now also the
center of saint petersburg
and
personally i saw hundreds or even
thousands people who were
peacefully protesting against the
violence happening in ukraine
literally a lot of people around me were
sharing their opinions that they do not
support the decisions of our government
and they
want no war with ukraine
a lot of policemen were there it is the
center of the city once again a lot of
policemen were there
personally i have seen about 100 of
people being detained
arrested i don't know how to say that
word correctly in english but i think
you got my idea about
100 of people i personally saw being
detained in saint petersburg waiting in
the bus
to i guess to deliver them to a police
station
and many more people were protesting
kind of peacefully the only thing they
did
is
chanting and shouting two things
no war
and peace to ukraine of course shouting
that in russian
i talked to quite a lot of people on the
streets
uh
every single one of them were
not happy with the current events and
some of them shared how
confused
how
bad they feel about
the conflict about the
war with ukraine because they have
friends
they have family members who live in
ukraine they have friends and family
members who live
here in russia and they
have no idea what to think and what to
expect
from the next
days and weeks
i saw a lot of people
who were having quite
frustrated
and confused faces
the protest itself wasn't really active
the only thing what people did was
chanting and shouting
but there was no aggression towards the
police
troops
as well as there was no
big violence from police towards people
like i witnessed a year ago
but it's the first day yesterday was the
first day when russian people went on
the streets so perhaps it's gonna be
changed um today or tomorrow i have no
idea
[Applause]
but generally what i saw yesterday it
was
like not too bad
and it was actually very nice to see a
lot of like-minded people going to the
streets to
share their opinion because there is one
thing about protesting in russia that
perhaps you don't know and
perhaps i should say that
to explain to clarify some things like
technically and legally protesting is
legal in russia
every single person can express their
feelings towards political decisions of
our government but realistically and
practically if people gather to show
their protest to show their opinion
especially collectively then uh most
likely many of these people will get
detained by police
the exact number from yesterday
is one thousand and seven hundred people
were detained across all russia protests
happened in 52 russian cities at least
that's the information i found
yesterday online once i got back home
around 11 pm
it's a lot of people it's still not
that much compared to last year protests
but it is a huge number
and
even me
who is going to
stream live stream and share the view of
the streets that night without taking an
action without
being protesting actively even a person
like me who is just standing there
literally doing nothing for a protest
still takes a risk
for being detained and perhaps having
some serious consequences for being in
the wrong place in the wrong time you
understand what i mean
yay so i'll keep this video short it's
not a typical video i post it's not
really a cultural daily life video
about my
life here in russia but i thought it's
worth it to share because
there are a lot of misunderstandings
there's a lot of misinformation
on both of the sites on our tv on your
tv on our media and on foreign medias
if you want to see more in real life
russian streets i started streaming more
often on tick tock so you can find me
there but still say nikki brushing on
tiptoe and also nikki brush on instagram
if you are keen to see a bit more of my
personal opinion towards
recent stuff and also a bit more of my
daily life
thank you for hearing me out and peace
