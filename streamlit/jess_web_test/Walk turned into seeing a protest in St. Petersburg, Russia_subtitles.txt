hello everyone from the streets of saint
petersburg russia my name is nikki i am
russian and i live in saint petersburg
this year this video i'm going to share
what is going on here these days sunday
and monday february 27 28 and i'm going
to share my personal perception and
feeling towards this stuff and also
share two biggest things that russian
people are talking about
the
financial situation and the ruble
russian rural
falling exchange rate and the
ukrainian russian conflict i'm staying
here with my friend muhammad
hey everyone what's up how's it going
and i guess mohammed will share a bit
about his perspective as a foreigner who
lives in russia well personal talk first
i want to share what happened yesterday
the evening of sunday
it was
the evening i was hanging out with my
friends and one hour i decided to check
how much is one dollar in russian ruble
and the normal exchange rate for that
day it was like
one usd
80 russian rubles more or less that hour
it was a little bit up like 83 rubles
for one dollar mean
that russian ruble got down
one hour later i checked it again and it
was like more or less the same but next
moment i saw an update from russian news
saying that think of bank my bank
started to sell dollars for 150 russian
rubles which is almost double price i
checked it and it was
real
yeah basically it was the first moment
when i realized that russian ruble is
going to go insane go crazy just like it
was in 2014 when it doubled like dropped
two times
and
since then i feel a little bit uneasy
about the economical situation
here in russia because such thing
basically the effect of sanctions will
touch will affect every single person in
russia doesn't matter if that person
supports what's going on in ukraine or
disagrees with that
another personal moment was today um the
noontime 12 o'clock saint petersburg
time i got news that russia and ukraine
are going to have a negotiation process
somewhere in between ukraine and belarus
12 o'clock
there was a live translation set up by
one of belo russian news agencies
i went to see it on youtube live and
what happened five minutes later there
was a strange
lady in white who just came
and said hey this lie was not planned
like you should shut it down to i guess
somebody who organized that life
for the negotiation process anyways um
after seeing the news about the
negotiation between my country and
ukraine i was like starting to have a
hope that
perhaps somehow it will change into a
bit more
positive into a bit more better
direction although till now i have no
idea if they have any agreement i
haven't been back home yet
an hour later i will be and i'll check
how they dealt with that
and another thing is about
just general feeling of what's going on
here in saint peter's work and how the
people feel about the recent events
and every single day i see people really
concerned about it
see people on subway reading newspapers
and checking their phones for updates
much more than before
i also see people keep protesting in
russia and here when number come
like one year ago when we were
protesting supporting navalny
across the entire country we had 5 000
people who were detained and later
arrested and
fined for a really big sum of money
now
protesting for
hey there so now protesting against
the
conflict visio brain
we have
a number that over
reached
the numbers from last year more than 5
and 200 people were detained
starting from thursday and if you ask
what happens to them next some of them
are getting arrested for days or for
weeks
some of them are getting fined for
really big sum of money much more than
average monthly income and some of them
are getting community service
if they didn't uh do anything against
policemen if they don't hit don't touch
policeman in a case they did
any kind of like
physical action towards police troops
they are getting
arrested much longer time but people
still protest across the entire country
including this beautiful city of saint
petersburg which is a freaking museum
here in the city center actually one
kilometer over there is the place where
people get to protest these days and we
will go to have a walk and see if there
is anything going on today because it's
about seven to eight pm already people
got off their work and
every single day before they were going
to get war station and protest
and we'll see if they are doing this
today well let's talk a bit to muhammad
and ask how does sanctions affect
a life of a foreign person living in
russia saint petersburg well my friends
i'm going to share how this situation
affects me as a foreigner working and
living here in pittsburgh russia well
the first thing i do in the morning when
i woke up is checking the rate
yesterday before i get to sleep it was
one dollar
it was 84 rubles and when i woke up in
the morning i checked the rate again and
one dollar was
121
rebels and that was crazy so
if i have my salary let's say i have
like 1 000 uh dollars which was
75 000 rubles today my salary is the
same 75 000 rubles but it's not 1 000 us
dollars anymore it is about 600.
well
since i'm i send money back home to my
family now i can't send them the same
amount i used to and i'm struggling here
financially well
i hope this will get much better in the
next few days so
i don't know man but we will see it's
hard a little bit tough here
waiting no one understand anything even
russian people they don't know what's
going on it's the hardest part when
you're confused and you have no idea
what is going to happen not just next
month but next week and even next day
even next moment we were buying a power
bank right now
and it cost like 1 800 rubles and when
we took the bar bank went to the cat to
the cashier
it cost like 1 000
95
well it's like 105 troubles more at the
same moment so that's horrible we will
see what is going on now back to nikki
well the last thing that i want to show
you is getting involved station if
there's any protesting happening right
now and if not i'm just taking a subway
right from head station back home
while we are going there i want to
remind that i have instagram account
where i cover the recent events and how
i feel about it and what i see by my own
eyes
find me on instagram i also do lives on
tiktok if you want to see in real life
ask me any questions during the live
stream go find me on tik tok and if
you're feeling like that you can support
me on patreon either on paypal
i really appreciate that can you
actually see this police lights police
cars yeah
yeah i can't see them i was there we are
really close to the protestants and do
you see the police cars
here and there and there's actually
people
yeah there are people protesting let's
get closer so let's have a look what is
around first this beautiful building
behind the trolleybus is gastine dvor
one of the marketplace from imperial
russia you see a lot of police and
actually a lot of police troops staying
over there in the helmets
some or them like they're called ammon
which is special police troops and also
a lot of uh just regular people over
there and i believe next to the subway
stations that is the entrance to subway
station
now let's talk a bit about the police
cars so basically you see such kind of
minivans uh vans that is basically the
cars that carries police troops police
members
and there is a car that is called
aftazak it's basically designed to carry
protestants from this site of the
protest to i guess police department so
basically the troops will be catching
the most active protestants and
carrying them to the afterzak
apparently there are too many protesters
and one or two afterthoks will not cover
that will not take all the
people and they have such a bus like
literally this bus is having the same
the same function as the afterzak
and it's much bigger
we have a lot of regular people staying
here we also have press wearing such
kind of yellow greenish jackets and they
basically
film anything what is going on around
for local news i guess and we have a lot
of policemen standing right next to the
streets
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh
so basically we are having the first
people taken by police to the bars
and basically half of people stopped
shouting and went far away from here and
the rest still staying
just a quick message i safely arrived to
my neighborhood my hobbit is back home
too so we are alright thank you for
watching and watch this video if you
want to see more stuff about russia
