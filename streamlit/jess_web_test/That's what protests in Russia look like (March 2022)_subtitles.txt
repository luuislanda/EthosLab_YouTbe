good sunday afternoon from saint
petersburg russia my name is nikki i
live in think videos work and share my
daily life
here in russia's people but apparently
today my daily life is going to the city
center
and seeing and witnessing the protests
against what's going on on ukraine it's
around 2 30 p.m here in saint petersburg
cities like novosibirsk krasnoyars
vladivostok yakitorinburg
they are hours ahead of saint petersburg
and people already went protesting there
and i um got the recent update about
half an hour ago that 1 000 people was
already detained today and it's not
talking about people in moscow and saint
petersburg because half an hour ago
basically the protest hasn't started yet
in moscow and petersburg a few things to
clarify about protests in russia people
were going protesting across the entire
country since the first day of
the conflict between russia and ukraine
uh starting on thursday february 24th
the first day really was massive a lot
of people went outdoors
protesting a lot of people were detained
and every next day was actually not as
massive as the first day of protesting
and yet people kept going to
protest every single day after finishing
their day job on weekdays and basically
during the afternoon during the weekends
every single time when people joined
protests before today it was not kind of
organized people basically uh showed a
good level of self-organization but this
sunday's protest is actually organized
by the team of navalny they spread a lot
of information about that and uh looks
like today's protest is actually going
to be more massive than last thursday
there's really a lot of people around me
and there's also a lot of police troops
even kilometers away from the protesting
site
[Music]
i'm staying somewhere near the
protesters like best in the world
station
staying nearby and here's the things
that i noticed today
most of people who um came here they
clearly came here to uh see and to
protest but the majority of people
actually don't go to the augustine wars
square because they are kind of scared
to get detained i believe
so they take a walk from one side to
another i also noticed a lot of buses
that look ordinary like normal city
transport buses but they do not have any
letters about where this bus is going it
just says to the park and some of them
go independently some of them are being
followed by a police car so what i
realized now is
police has
special cars for transporting arrested
and detained people we call that
afterzak in russian but today apparently
they do not have enough afterthoks to
carry all the detained people so they
make use of a regular transport i
already saw three full buses of people
getting out of this square and some
buses empty ones coming back here so
apparently we have quite a lot of people
detained already here in saint
petersburg just about half an hour one
hour since the protest is started
and
hopefully i'm not going to be one of
these people inside of these buses after
a 10 minute walk i got to another place
the admiralty admiral taste which is
right between the winter palace the
hermitage museum and the isaac cathedral
and i'm basically meeting my friends
here right now and they're going for a
walk somewhere around and see what's
going on we are having people in press
jackets who are
i guess doing their jobs here and
interestingly enough uh press has such
kind of green yellowish jackets and the
press sign
and even like this
and even like this today i received some
news about journalists about fresh
people getting detained right while
doing their jobs
[Applause]
foreign
it was about 10 minutes staying on the
admiralty square and doing literally
nice until the moment when a lot of
people gathered at one place and they
started shouting so like somebody
started shouting no to war nearby in
russian
and then
a lot of people around they just started
chanting all together
basically
going from one place to another
yeah
so i don't know what is exactly
happening now for like people who stayed
here
but we had a fedex member saying
that we have to stay here not moving
anywhere
and we have a part of people running
inside of the
like door
and many more people
caught in between police members
so basically it's just like this
uh police is over there
there is the
i don't know inner yard of this building
and some people got inside
trying to hide from police and police
members just get indoors
so i guess
so i guess every single person who gets
inside of the building and who didn't
listen to police perhaps they will get
detained and go to the past not sure
about me and people around me
so far a few minutes staying here and
it's like we are blocked by police from
one side from another side
and i don't know if we can go anywhere
apparently people go
so we'll see if we can actually pass
through
damn this car is
huge
apparently i'm all right just followed
the crowd and uh
it's all right now but the people who
try to escape police and try to run
they are actually getting in trouble uh
they are more likely to
detain people who somehow do not listen
to the orders
which i
kind of do if policemen say stay here i
just stay and wait until all the crowd
goes somewhere else
yeah so there's the guy who was having
like no two war
piece of paper and
i think he ran like for 100 meters
but no he literally if you run away
literally no chance like too many
policemen around here
but while this pretty building is kazan
cathedral and this wonderful
architecture around saint petersburg dom
zingara
malacana street and nyaski prospects the
longest and the most beautiful street in
saint petersburg city
i think it's the right moment to clarify
what exactly is
enough reason to get detained in russia
and basically you see me walking the
streets and not shouting not saying
anything not joining protestants
protesters actually because that is uh
an enough reason to get detained i also
don't hold any piece of paper or any
kind of protesting attribute stuff
because that is a bigger reason to get
detained exactly what happened to this
guy
with note of war paper here you may ask
why people do not help other people why
they do not stop police somehow prevent
them from catching people
um unfortunately if you touch police
anyhow if you hurt them anyhow you most
likely will get arrested for a couple of
years we have some ridiculous examples
of of it and people basically don't do
anything don't touch police
and just follow their orders
[Music]
the reason i upload this video is
basically make things a little bit more
transparent to show you what's going on
around me in saint petersburg russia so
hopefully you got an understanding of
what's going on here in russia and
hopefully you saw that not all russian
people are actually supporting what's
going on between my country and ukraine
