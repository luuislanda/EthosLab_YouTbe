        - json - standard nested json file. Works great for web apps and web things
        - webvtt - metadata and format rich alternative for srt. Good for hipsters and HTML5 devs

st.markdown("* If a playlist or video in text file is not available/deleted/hidden/geo-restricted, the code will break. My mechanism to bypass this doesn't work in the web app but it does offline so this is top priority that is very fixable!")

st.markdown("* No PDF support. Converting to txt manually is not ideal, PDF reading is non-trivial though so it probably will take a few hours to write code for it. Also maybe add support for doc/docx?")
st.markdown("* Generally not a UI/UX person so some feedback on general use and presentation of the tool is very welcome!")
st.markdown("* User has to click twice to download subtiltes, once to generate the file and another to download it. This is due to the streamlit webframework's restrictions. Nothing crazy but ideally we wouldn't click ")
