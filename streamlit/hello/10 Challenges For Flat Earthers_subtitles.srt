1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,460
Hey everyone, so it’s been almost exactly
a year since I published my innocuous little

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,090
flat earth debunk as part of my astronomy series.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,320
That was the one that the globebusters foolishly
engaged with, and their idiotic insult-filled

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,590
commentary prompted me to make this little
gem that they never recovered from.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,180
Then based on the ridiculous comments I received
on that video, I made one more to mock the

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,090
moronic things that all flat earthers say
verbatim, or at least they did until that

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,580
video made the rounds.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,240
And then I put the whole thing down for a while.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,610
It was never my intention to make that sort
of content, but it was quite satisfying, and

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,290
I got ten times the views of my normal content,
which was definitely a plus.

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,250
But I had to move on,
lest I be tempted to rebrand myself from a

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,110
channel with academic intentions to one devoted
purely to debunking con men.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,190
However, it’s been a year, I’ve done so
many tutorials since then, so why not jump

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,050
back in the muck for a moment.

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,079
This time, I’d like to offer some challenges
to you remaining few that are desperately

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,600
clinging to this dying fad to derive some
semblance of self-worth.

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,860
Let’s call them:
Ten Challenges for Flat Earthers.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,600
These will be some basic things that anyone
could do to test the flat earth hypothesis.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,180
They are so mind-numbingly obvious, that the
fact that you don’t do them is an immediate

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,150
indicator of your complete lack of intellectual
integrity.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,200
Let’s get started and you’ll see what
I mean.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Number one.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,470
Here’s the flat earth map that you all seem
to agree upon.

24
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,290
Anyone with half a brain can immediately tell
that this does not correlate with reality,

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,900
but for those with an even smaller fraction,
let’s do a few things to prove it.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,370
For example, make a scale.

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,810
You know, a scale?

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,270
It’s that thing on maps that tells you how
far away things are from each other.

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,270
Look at this map.

30
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,690
There’s a scale.

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,690
You can pick two cities and determine the
approximate distance between them.

32
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:58,160
Then you can drive your car from one to another
and verify that it is the correct distance.

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,640
Now back to your little map.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,799
Where’s the scale here?

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,810
Why do you never include one?

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,329
Is it because it’s impossible?

37
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,079
Yes, that is exactly why.

38
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,310
And if you disagree, here’s your challenge.

39
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,899
Pick some distance on this map.

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,220
A centimeter, an inch, whatever.

41
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,570
Tell me the distance it corresponds to in reality.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,290
Then, pick some cities, and use your scale
to estimate the distances between them.

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,680
Pick two on the same continent, pick two on
different continents.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,120
Use it to tell me how wide this inappropriately
enormous ocean is.

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,910
Use it to tell me literally anything about
the distances between literally anything.

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,630
When you can’t do it, and your numbers do
not correlate with reality in the slightest,

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,930
recall that this map does it just fine, and
then admit that your map is stupid.

48
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,709
Your complete inability to make any kind of
remotely legitimate map single-handedly proves

49
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,180
the earth isn’t flat.

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,070
But let’s continue just for fun.

51
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,070
Number two.

52
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,090
As we all know, the existence of Antarctica
poses a huge problem for you.

53
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,010
When it is summer in the northern hemisphere,
you love to pretend that the sun moves inwards

54
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,010
to this tropic, making the days longer here,
and shorter in the southern hemisphere.

55
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,519
And then when it’s winter in the north,
you like to put the sun at the other tropic,

56
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,540
which you think gives you the shorter days
up north that you want, but in the south it’s

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,690
total chaos.

58
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,620
You have the sun tracing this enormous trajectory,
which would leave everything out here in darkness

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,950
for most of the day, when in reality, there
are long periods of time in Antarctica where

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,840
the sun never sets.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,010
Since your dinky little sun can never illuminate
this entire fantasy ice wall at once, this

62
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,150
compeletely obliterates your model, which
is why you resort to conspiracy.

63
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,680
You simply deny that this midnight sun ever
occurs, while claiming that no one can go

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,360
to Antarctica to verify it for themselves,
because the government NASA Jew penguins will

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
kill you.

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,960
Well apart from all the commercial cruises,
civilians can even apply for jobs there, so

67
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,800
you totally could go see it for yourself.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,920
But you don’t really have to go all the
way to Antarctica.

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Just go to the tip of South America, like
this town where people live.

70
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,569
Or don’t even go there, just look up times
of sunrise and sunset on the internet.

71
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,490
In mid-December, sunrise is earlier than 5
AM, and sunset is later than 10 PM.

72
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,280
Now take your little model for the seasons,
and make it show night and day.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,889
Then try and make the night and day portions
match up with these sunrise and sunset times.

74
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,300
Demonstrate the light from the sun illuminating
this location for more than 70 percent of

75
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,589
its trajectory.

76
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:30,119
And as you do that, make sure that it does
not illuminate Point Barrow, Alaksa, whatsoever

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,160
during its entire trajectory, as that town
has endless night during this time of the year.

78
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,660
That’s right.

79
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,339
Lots of sun over here, and zero sun over here.

80
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,339
Good luck.

81
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,279
If you decide to even try, observe that the
light patterns become so nonsensical that

82
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,300
not even the most meth-fueled creatives amongst
you could vomit enough magnetism jargon to

83
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,550
justify it.

84
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,370
If you can’t make your model show the seasons
and night and day at the same time, as I pointed

85
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:03,069
out that you can’t almost a year ago, then
seriously consider shutting up forever.

86
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,069
Number three.

87
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,069
Here’s an idea.

88
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,909
What if you were to actually make a prediction
with your model?

89
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,939
Like, any prediction.

90
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,419
You know, those things you have to do in science
for it to be science?

91
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,300
Pick any celestial object.

92
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
A planet.

93
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
A comet.

94
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
A star.

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,780
Now pick any time in the future.

96
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,779
And using only the flat earth model and nothing
else, tell me where it will be at that time.

97
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:30,389
If you can’t do this, and I know you can’t,
consider admitting that your model is absolutely

98
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,469
irrelevant.

99
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:35,580
People who actually understand the geometry
of the earth and the solar system can predict

100
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,349
a solar eclipse, specifying the start and
end time down to the second, and tracing its

101
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,870
precise path down to the square mile.

102
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,080
Doing that even a single time means the model
used to make the prediction has been undeniably

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,219
verified, and it’s done every single time.

104
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:00,849
Anyone who doesn’t see the importance of
that has no clue how science works.

105
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:01,849
Number four.

106
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:06,199
After I demolished essentially all of your
favorite talking points in my previous videos,

107
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,330
you all now cling primarily to the classic
“I shouldn’t see this thing” argument.

108
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,840
You love this one because you can lie about
heights and distances, do incorrect math,

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,960
and in general act incredulous without having
to actually do any science.

110
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,530
Well every time you whine about this, the
objects are always suspiciously close, such

111
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,749
that you can fudge the numbers, and they’re
always over water, so you can lie about refractive

112
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,759
effects to people who have no idea how refraction
works.

113
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,590
So try this one on for size.

114
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,849
Show me a picture of something over land that’s
a thousand miles away.

115
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,930
May I suggest the middle of the country where
there’s not much in the way.

116
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,129
It’s a straight shot after all, so what’s
the problem?

117
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,550
Use a telescope.

118
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,309
Pull Las Vegas into focus from Dallas, Texas.

119
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,759
Isn’t that where you have your little meeting?

120
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,599
Maybe you should try doing something productive
rather than blindly perpetuating the dumbest

121
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,039
hoax on the internet.

122
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,039
Number five.

123
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,309
Speaking of things that are far away, you
all love whipping out your Nikons so much

124
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:08,659
that I wouldn’t be surprised if a Nikon
executive dreamt up the entire flat earth

125
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,249
hoax as a viral marketing campaign.

126
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:15,370
You take a boat that’s far away, pull it
back into focus, and then marvel at your own

127
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,629
brilliance for figuring out how to operate
a camera.

128
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,270
Well try this one then.

129
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Stay on the boat.

130
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,889
Don’t cut away.

131
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,069
Stay on it until it disappears.

132
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,529
How will it disappear?

133
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,050
Bottom up.

134
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,080
Just like everything else.

135
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,069
I wonder why you’ve never put that on YouTube?

136
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,009
Number six.

137
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,999
The most hilarious thing about flat earth
is that the most mundane, every day observations

138
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,709
make absolutely no sense in your model.

139
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:42,959
Like a sunset.

140
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,300
A small sun above a flat earth would simply
recede high in the sky and get smaller and

141
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,340
smaller until it fades away.

142
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,439
It absolutely would not retain the same angular
size and set below the horizon.

143
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,559
It stays the same size because it’s unbelievably
far away, and it sets below the horizon because

144
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,150
the earth is a sphere that is turning.

145
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,080
Even a toddler can understand this.

146
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,149
It’s so blatantly obvious that you have
to resort to your typical ad hoc antics, talking

147
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:15,099
about refractive effects that defy all logic
and somehow magically apply to the sun but

148
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,289
nothing else.

149
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,710
Or even better, some of you talk about about
a dome with the sun on the other side that

150
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,650
produces some bizarre optical effect.

151
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,080
Apart from the sheer absurdity of this magical
dome that no one has ever seen or touched,

152
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,939
it creates big problems for you, because you
also claim that the sun and moon perform other

153
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:38,079
kinds of magic to push the air and water around,
to get tides and storms and what have you.

154
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,899
That would require that it is inside the dome.

155
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:41,899
So which is it?

156
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,500
Is the sun outside of the magical non-existent
dome, so you can pretend to get the sunset,

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,800
or is it inside the magical non-existent dome,
so you can pretend to get the tides?

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,130
It can’t be both.

159
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,579
Or if you bail on the dome and say it’s
just water, how do all those water molecules

160
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:02,329
that make up around one percent of the atmosphere
produce a thousand times greater refractive

161
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,959
effect than actual liquid water?

162
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,589
How does the appearance of a sunset never
vary at all, whether it’s dry or humid or raining?

163
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,720
Why does nothing else but the sun behave that way?

164
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,019
Show me a projectile or a plane going below
the horizon as it recedes.

165
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,070
Or show me this dome and explain the phenomena
with more than buzzwords.

166
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,410
Do something to explain a sunset.

167
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,259
Do anything besides making idiotic videos
with action movie soundtracks that contradict

168
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,640
middle school level science.

169
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,190
Number seven.

170
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,180
What the hell is a lunar eclipse to you?

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Seriously.

172
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,209
Explain anything about a lunar eclipse.

173
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,019
The things you say about solar eclipses are
stupid enough, but at least you say something.

174
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,129
A lunar eclipse happens when the earth gets
between the sun and the moon.

175
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:53,339
That’s right.

176
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,600
In between.

177
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,940
These two objects are not perpetually above
a flat plane, and you know it, which is why

178
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,680
you’re totally silent on lunar eclipses.

179
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,520
And if you’re going to propose that some
other object besides the earth is what obscures

180
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,470
the moon, good luck trying to demonstrate
its existence.

181
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,470
Number eight.

182
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,290
Speaking of the sun and moon being small and
close to the earth, what is stopping you from

183
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,560
strapping a camera to a weather balloon and
sending it up there?

184
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,520
Go get up close and personal with either of
these objects and take some pictures.

185
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,040
If you get crafty with some robotics, which
is a stretch given your complete lack of education,

186
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,130
you could even scoop up a little sample.

187
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,089
Maybe the moon is made of cheese after all.

188
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,810
Can’t you get even halfway there, such that
the sizes change?

189
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,449
Reach for the sky, fellas.

190
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,449
Number nine.

191
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:41,670
Take some flights.

192
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,089
Like any direct flight in the southern hemisphere.

193
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,089
Whoops!

194
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,480
Shouldn’t that be impossible?

195
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
Better yet, fly between two cities two different
ways, the shortest way on the globe, and the

196
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,390
shortest way on the flat earth.

197
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,250
Which one do you think will be faster?

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,100
I’m just joking, I know that none of you
will ever be employed long enough to afford

199
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
a private jet.

200
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,990
But next time you’re on a regular plane,
notice that flights going east or west are

201
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,360
not constantly turning slightly to one side,
as you seem to believe they all must be.

202
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Yeah.

203
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,399
You would notice that.

204
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,510
If humanity is unfortunate enough that you’ve
actually procreated, send your kid up to the

205
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,029
cockpit to meet the pilot and snap a pic of
the wheel.

206
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:21,329
What do you know, straight as an arrow.

207
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:22,769
And number ten.

208
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:27,230
Do anything legitimately scientific, at all.

209
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,360
Publish anything whatsoever about your model
in anything reputable anywhere.

210
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,379
Invent any technology based on your model.

211
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,339
Do anything at all that could be considered
actual empirical science.

212
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,449
Here’s a hint, you may have to study some
real science to do it, but then of course

213
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,949
you would immediately learn that the earth
isn’t flat, so it probably won’t be of

214
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,070
much use.

215
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,500
So that’s it for the ten challenges.

216
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,680
I say the word challenge facetiously, since
all of you will immediately recognize the

217
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,300
futility, and resort instead to calling me
names in the comments section.

218
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,839
You flat earth priests with your waste of
space channels know full well that doing anything

219
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,270
even remotely empirical demolishes your hoax,
which is why you stick to shouting conspiracy,

220
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,620
and very little else.

221
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,579
And you handful of mindless followers hanging
on to the only thing that makes you feel special,

222
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:20,980
maybe 2020 is the year you finally get a clue
and move on with your lives.

223
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,959
There’s a whole spherical world out there,
a world filled with people who won’t instantly

224
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,540
mock you or be ashamed to know you.

225
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,790
There are so many opportunities to actually
be a person of even minor consequence.

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,990
I know I’ve been hard on you, but I really
am rooting for you folks.

227
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,389
All you have to do is disengage from these
charlatans that lie for a living.

228
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:48,079
Save that ten dollar superchat and buy yourself
some dignity, or even put it in a college

229
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,149
fund so you can go to school and learn something useful.

230
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,670
The choice is yours.

231
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,999
Good luck, and good night.
