1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,740
It’s Professor Dave, and I wanna show you the world.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,259
Throughout this astronomy series, we’ve
learned quite a bit about every object you

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,480
could hope to see in the night sky, as well
as many others that you can’t.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,770
So how does all of this fit in with the understanding
held by the common public?

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,890
For one thing, just the way that an understanding
of chemistry and biochemistry makes it easy

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,079
to refute things like alternative medicine,
the understanding of astronomy we have just

7
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,989
gained will make it easy to refute similarly
alternative cosmological models, most notably

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,720
the present fad that is the flat-earth model.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,739
There exists a community of folks who believe
that contrary to everything the human species

10
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,880
has learned over the past few centuries, the
world is not spherical, but is instead flat,

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,390
and is also the center of the universe.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,430
A knee-jerk reaction to this is often one
of disbelief and even mockery, but rather

13
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,500
than go that route, let’s consider this
model in a rigidly academic way.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,750
Whether the earth is flat or round, we should
be able to demonstrate it, and show how all

15
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,460
astronomical phenomena make sense in one model
versus the other.

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,640
Let’s go through some of these phenomena
now, and put them into context.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,540
First, let’s just look at the celestial sphere.

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,180
We look up and we see stars and planets going around.

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,520
The flat earth model says we stay still while
everything goes around us, and the round earth

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,680
model says we rotate, which is what causes
the apparent motion of objects in the sky.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
At face value, with no further investigation,
these are two completely valid hypotheses.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,310
Either of them could feasibly explain what
we see in the sky.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,680
Now let’s dig a little deeper.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,960
What are some details we notice about the
celestial sphere and certain earthly phenomena?

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,860
We experience night and day, alternating periods
of light and dark that change over time.

26
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,519
We see the ecliptic.

27
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:17,219
This is the part of the sky that traces the
sun’s path throughout the year, as well

28
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,360
as the paths of all the planets.

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,079
The path of the sun follows a slowly tilting
pattern that lasts one year.

30
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:33,359
This length of time also outlines other cycles
observed on earth, which we call the seasons.

31
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:39,180
These seasons go a particular way in the northern
hemisphere, and the opposite way in the southern

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,239
hemisphere.

33
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,799
There exists a phenomenon called the Coriolis
effect, whereby rotating masses like storms

34
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,400
rotate in one direction in the northern hemisphere
and the other direction in the southern hemisphere.

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,610
Each hemisphere also sees an entirely different
collection of stars.

36
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,329
These are just a handful of the observations
we can make that beg to be explained.

37
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,109
Here is where the round earth becomes obvious.

38
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:15,010
All we have to do is understand that the earth
is roughly spherical, spinning on an axis

39
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,069
tilted somewhat from the vertical, and going
around the sun just like all the other planets.

40
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:28,680
This singular assumption makes all of the
observations fall into place.

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,469
As earth rotates, it’s daytime when facing
the sun and nighttime when facing away from

42
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,469
the sun.

43
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:40,260
The apparent motion of all these celestial
objects utilizes elliptical paths, and can

44
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,889
therefore be predicted.

45
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,170
The seasons occur because of the amount of
sunlight hitting one hemisphere versus the

46
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,980
other at any given time in earth’s orbit.

47
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,209
One year is also no longer an arbitrary amount
of time, it’s equal to one revolution of

48
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:01,579
the earth around the sun, and the differing
lengths of night and day are also explained

49
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:04,489
by the tilt in the rotational axis.

50
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,200
The Coriolis effect is just the result of
simple physics related to rotating bodies

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,730
like the earth.

52
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:17,410
The hemispheres have different skies because
they point out at different regions of space.

53
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,400
Everything we see makes perfect sense with
one simple, unifying assumption.

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,270
That’s what science is all about.

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,310
In the flat earth model, all of these observations
require their own separate explanations.

56
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,820
What is night and day?

57
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,390
If you try to place a luminous object like
the sun above a plane like the flat earth,

58
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,230
how does light reach half the plane and not
the other half?

59
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,840
Say you come up with a mechanism whereby light
dissipates appropriately.

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,270
How does this then fit with other observations?

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,830
What are the seasons?

62
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,231
If you try to explain them by pulling the
sun closer and farther from the earth, how

63
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:01,250
can it be winter in the north and summer in the south?

64
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
What is the Coriolis effect?

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,020
If earth is a plane, what magically alters
the rotation of a storm in one half of the

66
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
plane compared to the other?

67
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,340
Shouldn’t we also all be seeing the same
night sky, since our lines of sight all face

68
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,440
the same direction?

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,530
Flat earth subscribers do actually attempt
to answer all of these questions, but beyond

70
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,690
the fact that the explanations are never mathematically
or logically sound, the sheer fact that each

71
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,380
phenomenon requires its own independent explanation
makes it unscientific.

72
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,660
If we invent a luminous sun-like object, and
start tracing elaborate paths through the

73
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,330
sky, this is just the epicycles from the geocentric
model all over again.

74
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,970
It’s assumption upon assumption, adjustment
upon adjustment, all of which are totally

75
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,710
ad hoc, based in nothing but an attempt to
fit observation.

76
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,490
This is very poor science.

77
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,140
When we say the earth is round and put the
sun at the center of all this motion, not

78
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,590
only are all of these phenomena easy to explain,
even to a layperson, but predictions can be made.

79
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:17,150
In 2017, a total solar eclipse occurred over
the United States.

80
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,310
Using a modern understanding of astronomy,
we can do math to predict any such event,

81
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,850
like eclipses, the return of Halley’s comet,
or anything else.

82
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,440
This is done very simply, with the sun at
the center, and using Kepler’s laws regarding

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,080
elliptical orbits, which involves basic algebra
accessible to anyone.

84
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,410
Only in this model is the math so easy.

85
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,700
So when we operate under this framework and
say that a solar eclipse is going to happen

86
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,980
at this time, on this day, in this place,
and then it does match our prediction with

87
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,770
extreme precision, there can be no clearer
vindication for this model of the solar system.

88
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,290
Game, set, match.

89
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,120
The flat earth model can never make such predictions,
not just because the notion of an eclipse

90
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,060
has no logical basis, but also as there is
no unifying mathematical system.

91
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,590
It’s a bunch of separate phenomena with
separate explanations, if such explanations

92
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,860
even exist.

93
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,930
It doesn’t end there.

94
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,120
The flat earth model has a huge laundry list
of other things to explain besides what we

95
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,430
have mentioned so far.

96
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,810
Everything we see in space is a sphere.

97
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,050
Why is earth the only thing that isn’t?

98
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,030
Things fall to the earth because of gravity,
which attracts things to earth’s center

99
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,370
of mass.

100
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,960
If earth is not a sphere, why do things fall
to the earth?

101
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,340
What is gravity?

102
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,240
The implications run so much deeper than just
what rotates around what.

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,430
Ad hoc solutions are offered, like the idea
that the flat earth is accelerating upwards

104
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,020
which an acceleration of 9.8 meters per second
squared, and that’s why we all stick to

105
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,110
the ground.

106
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,650
But this doesn’t help, it actually makes
things worse.

107
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,330
What is up?

108
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,470
What is causing the acceleration?

109
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,180
If it is constantly accelerating, we should
be traveling the speed of light by now.

110
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,030
What is meant to be a simple explanation actually
complicates things so much further.

111
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,020
Then there is the matter of the geometrical implications.

112
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,210
How do we slice up the globe to make it flat?

113
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,740
What places are far away that we thought were close?

114
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,700
How is it possible to fly or sail around the
world, which has indeed been done by so many people?

115
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,829
Where is the edge of the earth?

116
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,810
Why hasn’t anyone seen it?

117
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,110
What about all the pictures we have of the
earth from space?

118
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,209
Again, ad hoc solutions are required for all
of these questions.

119
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:55,330
It is proposed that a huge ice wall surrounds
the earth, which we call Antarctica.

120
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,139
No one can go there, because NASA is guarding it.

121
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,370
How?

122
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,870
Where is the personnel?

123
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,290
Where is the budget for such an operation?

124
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,930
NASA also fabricates all of the photos we see.

125
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,930
Why?

126
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,160
What is the motivation?

127
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,279
And how?

128
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,689
We have had photos of the earth from space
since the 60s, which predates computer editing

129
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,160
software by several decades.

130
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,899
The logical hole gets deeper and deeper.

131
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,610
Because it is impossible to form a consistent
framework for these observations, the model

132
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,690
must turn to conspiracy.

133
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,370
Now to be clear, I am a firm believer that
outside-the-box thinking should be encouraged,

134
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,870
and we should always be ready to challenge
institutions and governments, but the validity

135
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,560
of a conspiracy theory depends largely on
how many people have to be in on it.

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,069
The notion that all the governments and all
the scientists and all the airline pilots

137
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,749
and flight attendants and communication technology
operators and thousands of others are all

138
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:00,250
in on it… it starts to get pretty absurd.

139
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,999
The manufacturing of a holographic sphere
playing a movie of the heavens, which is operated

140
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:11,839
by unknown entities oppressing mankind into
deception and slavery is really what we are

141
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,550
left with for the flat-earth model, and perhaps
that realization makes the whole thing make

142
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,820
sense.

143
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,709
It is the desire to live in a science fiction
movie and feel like the hero leading the fight

144
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:30,499
against evil forces that may be the best explanation
for the motivations involved with those who

145
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,730
insist on this model.

146
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,300
So that’s all there is to it.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,410
We do not say the earth is round because we’ve
been told it’s round, or because we are

148
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,430
repeating scientific dogma.

149
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,220
We say it is round because it is the simplest
explanation for what we see.

150
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,860
The earth is round because the round earth
model makes perfect sense of every observation

151
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,149
we can make.

152
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:57,249
No ad hoc reasoning, just a bunch of puzzle
pieces that fit together to form a coherent

153
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,170
view of the universe and everything in it.

154
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,930
This is the same reason that the heliocentric
model replaced the geocentric model when Copernicus

155
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,290
and Kepler came around.

156
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,249
It just works better.

157
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:14,389
The orbits of the planets don’t have to
be explained by epicycles upon epicycles.

158
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:20,040
If the sun is at the center of the solar system,
the planets follow very simple ellipses, and

159
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,800
Kepler’s laws predict the positions of planets
with much better accuracy and precision than

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,040
any previous model.

161
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,269
When the world is round, everything fits.

162
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,560
In contrast, the flat earth model has to come
up with ad hoc modifications to explain each

163
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,080
and every observation in a different way.

164
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,390
All of these problems simply vanish with a
round earth.

165
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,699
The earth is round, and what we see makes perfect sense.

166
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,991
The precise position of every celestial object
can be predicted with great accuracy, far

167
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,269
into the future.

168
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,040
We can say that an eclipse will happen at
a particular time on a particular day in a

169
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,519
particular place, and that’s exactly what we see.

170
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,790
This is the essence of good science.

171
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,579
A model or theory that correlates mountains
of data to form a simple and cohesive explanation

172
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:15,570
for observations, and makes falsifiable predictions
regarding phenomena.

173
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,950
If a model can’t do that, it’s not scientific,
and the flat-earth model simply does not hold

174
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,579
up to scrutiny, so it must be discarded, as
it was for the majority of the human race

175
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,490
a few thousand years ago.

176
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,920
Now that we’ve caught back up to what we
already knew, let’s move forward and see

177
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,660
what else we can say about the public’s
perception of space.
