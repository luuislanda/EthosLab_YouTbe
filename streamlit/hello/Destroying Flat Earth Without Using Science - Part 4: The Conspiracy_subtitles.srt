1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:04,200
Hey everyone, so in this little series I’ve
been demonstrating that the earth isn’t

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,330
flat without using any science, simply by
looking at things like the moon and stars

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,809
and airline flights.

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:14,849
But believe it or not, there is an even easier
way to prove that flat earth is the dumbest

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,730
hoax on the internet, which involves no observations
of any kind.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,220
And that is to examine the conspiracy itself.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,110
So to begin, let’s remind ourselves of what
flat earth priests would have you believe.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,680
They tell a story of how the most powerful
people in the world over the past several

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,770
thousand years have conspired to convince
its citizens that what they live on is a different

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,090
shape than what it really is.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,870
Beginning as a simple lie, it slowly ballooned
in scope, culminating in the 21st century

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:53,350
landscape we are now familiar with, where
every single celestial phenomenon, every field

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:59,960
of science, and every aspect of technology
must revolve around this spectacular lie.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,420
Trillions of dollars are spent every year
on fake space missions, and paying off an

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,460
unthinkable number of people, an army of shills,
all to keep the deception going.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,939
Clearly, this is nothing short of the deepest
and most well-orchestrated plot humanity has

17
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,170
ever conjured.

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:24,000
It represents a level of cost, coordination,
and airtight secrecy that seems utterly impossible.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
But then again, the stakes are high.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
What is the payoff for all this effort?

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,280
What do these ultra-elites gain by filling
the sheeple’s heads with images of globes

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,799
and outer space?

23
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,069
The answer is…

24
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,530
Nothing.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,909
Yep, that’s right.

26
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:45,249
Nothing whatsoever.

27
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:50,229
There is absolutely nothing that anyone could
gain from telling this lie.

28
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,610
Flat earth priests themselves typically don’t
even bother offering a rationale as to the

29
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,610
motive.

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,170
For the few that do, what do they say?

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,649
Some of them say it’s “to hide god”.

32
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:02,990
Seriously.

33
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,209
This is very dumb, as any god who is so weak
that it can be hidden by its own creations

34
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,360
is clearly not worth worshipping.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,830
Also, if that was the plan, then it totally
didn’t work, since most people in the world

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,480
do believe in some kind of god.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,560
Others insist that it’s all about some form
of control, but again, this is stupid.

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Beyond not offering any tangible control,
you don’t need such a huge conspiracy to

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,710
control a people anyway.

40
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,240
Look at any authoritarian dictatorship.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,110
North Korea does this wonderfully by restricting
liberties, internet access, and using forced

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,760
labor and executions.

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Viola!

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,270
A brainwashed people under strict control!

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,540
As for most of the rest of us, we do pretty
much whatever we want.

46
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,480
We have to have jobs, and we get into credit
card debt, and banks have too much power,

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,320
yadda yadda yadda, but the shape of the earth
has nothing to do with it, and lying about

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,990
the shape of the earth would give no one any
advantage or any measure of control whatsoever.

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,490
There is no wealth to be lost if people were
to find out the earth is flat, nor is there

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,620
any power to be gained by the masses through
such a revelation.

51
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,820
Speaking strictly socially, nothing would
change.

52
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,100
So the idea that people are spending trillions
of dollars per year to push such a lie is

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,190
idiotic.

54
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,510
Nobody spends that kind of money for literally
no reason.

55
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,510
But that’s not all.

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,500
Let’s more thoroughly explore the social
ramifications of this.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,330
First up, the sciences.

58
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,100
If the earth is flat instead of roughly spherical,
and all of space is fake, there are several

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,900
scientific disciplines that must be deemed
fraudulent from top to bottom.

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,280
First, geology.

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,570
All geologists know the earth is a sphere,
so they must all be liars.

62
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,200
Then, physics.

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,710
Physicists know that gravity exists, which
it couldn’t on a flat earth, so they’re

64
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,900
all shills too.

65
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,290
Astronomy, you’d better believe it.

66
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,900
All of space is fake, so anyone who studies
space is a liar.

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,740
Everyone who talks about other planets, spacecraft,
volcanoes, earthquakes, earth’s atmosphere,

68
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,830
earth’s core, or anything even tangentially
related to any of these topics, must be in

69
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,880
on it.

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,489
This means two things, both of which are equally
absurd.

71
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:23,300
First, millions of scientists all over the
world, in dozens of different countries, whether

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,789
working under their government, universities,
or the private sector, are all somehow unified

73
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:34,400
under one hidden entity, and not a single
one of them is spilling the beans.

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,190
With flat earth there are no Edward Snowdens,
there are no Serpicos, not a single one has

75
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:47,180
come forward to offer a shred of insight as
to how this Orwellian scheme is propagated.

76
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,219
Even the President of the United States with
all the power at his disposal can’t receive

77
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:57,520
fellatio and keep it a secret, but a scam
about the shape of the planet we all walk

78
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,710
upon, with millions of people in on it?

79
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,569
No problem.

80
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:08,060
Second, since literally anyone can become
a scientist, there has to be a specific point

81
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,360
in the academic process where all the new
shills are inducted.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,370
So when is that exactly?

83
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,660
Is it second year of graduate school where
they take all the 23 year old kids to the

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,229
Eyes Wide Shut sex mansion party?

85
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,810
Or is that only after you have a PhD?

86
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,680
What about all the undergrads who are learning
the lies and can see that something isn’t

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
adding up, but haven’t been brought to the
sex party yet?

88
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,050
Shouldn’t any of them be asking questions?

89
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,090
Exactly where is the line between shill and
innocent, and wouldn’t any of those students

90
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,909
fast approaching that line be making YouTube
videos about it?

91
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,699
They’d be rich and famous, after all.

92
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,469
Moving on, it’s not all about academia,
either.

93
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,439
Let’s go to the federal level.

94
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,719
As much as flat earth priests pretend that
NASA is the only game in town when it comes

95
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,090
to space exploration, NASA isn’t even the
only space agency.

96
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,810
There are about a dozen others around the
world.

97
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,719
Then there is the private sector.

98
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,309
Obviously there is SpaceX and other such companies,
but why stop with rockets?

99
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:13,199
All pilots, or navigators of any kind, use
a spherical earth to get around.

100
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,509
Anyone who works in communications technology,
aerospace engineering, architecture, cartography,

101
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:26,590
meteorology, or even politics, just what percentage
of people on earth are in on the conspiracy?

102
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,050
When you consider all the aspects of our society
that rely on a spherical earth and a self-consistent

103
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,309
set of physical laws, it almost seems as though
the number of people that would be in on the

104
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:41,569
scam outnumber the ones that constitute the
mark.

105
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:46,009
And all of these corporations, which are beholden
to share holders, are they really throwing

106
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,889
money down the toilet paying salaries to people
who don’t actually do anything, and building

107
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:53,199
technology that serves no purpose?

108
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,129
That’s not how money works.

109
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,660
And finally, let’s get to the flat earth
priests themselves.

110
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,460
Those maverick renegades, those Neos in the
matrix.

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,729
This conspiracy has been going on for millennia,
but it ends now!

112
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:12,430
This secret society of Freemasons has had
every single world leader in their pocket

113
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,330
since the dawn of civilization, but they are
no match for a few high school dropouts with

114
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,110
YouTube channels!

115
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,180
Whatever are they going to do?

116
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,559
What could they possibly do except immediately
murder every single person who ever posts

117
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:30,150
a flat earth video in ten seconds with a laser
beam.

118
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:37,009
Honestly, given the magnitude of the conspiracy
as it is peddled, and the titanic power ascribed

119
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:43,139
to its progenitors, the fact that flat earth
channels even exist at all is proof that the

120
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,190
earth isn’t flat.

121
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,539
Why would these people spend thousands of
years and quadrillions of dollars to construct

122
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,539
the ultimate deception, and then risk losing
it all by letting some bozos talk into their

123
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:57,800
webcams?

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,639
Who could believe that they mastermind elaborate
narratives like a fake moon landing, building

125
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,449
hundreds of enormous rockets and making them
somehow disappear, fabricating tens of thousands

126
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,759
of new images per day, and yet they can’t
pay a hit man a couple grand to go take out

127
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,650
some slack-jawed basement dwellers?

128
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,050
This really is the bottom line.

129
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,509
If you’re uneducated, you can ignore all
the science.

130
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,499
If you’re lazy, you can ignore all the observations
of the sky.

131
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:31,580
If you’re stubborn, you can ignore all the
photographs of the Earth from space which

132
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,389
objectively are not CGI.

133
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:40,190
Even if you ignore all of that, the story
just doesn’t work.

134
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,070
America and the USSR were not cooperating
during the Cold War.

135
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,500
Conspiracies do not get passed down over a
hundred generations.

136
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,949
There is no Darth Sidious controlling the
empire from a secret base.

137
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,110
It makes no sense.

138
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,120
Of course in the end, we all know that it’s
a ruse.

139
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,070
Among all the internet hoaxes, flat earth
is unique in its stupidity.

140
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,970
It is just a meme that spiraled out of control.

141
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,540
It’s a satire of conspiracies that became
a parody of itself when people unexpectedly

142
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,800
actually started falling for it.

143
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
That’s when the latest wave of flathead
con men came into fashion.

144
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,700
These are the bottom feeders that scrape together
a meager living from livestreams aimed at

145
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,800
the same couple hundred poor saps desperately
searching for purpose where they otherwise

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
have none.

147
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,500
They are big fish in the smallest and most
pathetic pond imaginable.

148
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,530
This is why flat earth is the most stunning
example of the psychology of conspiracy in

149
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,589
existence.

150
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,560
It exemplifies the abandonment of logic that
some people are willing to enact in order

151
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,269
to reject the reality of their own inadequacies
and cling to a fantasy in which they are super-special,

152
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:54,829
part of the chosen handful of John Connors
who know the truth.

153
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:00,850
The simplest of minds are unable to accept
a reality that does not recognize their brilliance,

154
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,360
so any narrative that upholds their supreme
status will be blindly accepted, even if it

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,649
requires that basic logic and the laws of
physics be rewritten.

156
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:16,360
As long as it is anti-establishment, as long
as it rages against the non-existent machine,

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,569
as long as it requires no actual knowledge
or thinking, being ordained into this alternate

158
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:26,850
reality is the defense mechanism of choice
for the delusional narcissist with no skill

159
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,589
set to match.

160
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:34,810
And it is this most obvious of realizations
that leads me to part ways with the flat earth

161
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,810
phenomenon.

162
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,740
It was fun for a moment, but as far as I can
tell, it’s over.

163
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,569
The flat earth priests haven’t even acknowledged
my last few debunks, as they were just too

164
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,360
airtight to bother addressing.

165
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,440
The patronage of flerf channels is on the
decline.

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,730
Even the trolls with their sock accounts have
lightened their activity.

167
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,000
Whatever bizarre social experiment this incarnation
of flat earth was, it’s done.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,649
But what isn’t done is the psychology of
the delusional narcissist I just described.

169
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,240
This is something I’m not at all done with.

170
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,750
In fact I’ve only just begun.

171
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,670
This precise character shows up in the realm
of astrophysics, pretending to understand

172
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,160
the field better than astrophysicists.

173
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,029
It shows up in the realm of medicine, pretending
to understand the human body better than doctors

174
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,500
and biochemists.

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,960
While only a tiny percentage of these types
have the brain cell deficit required to fall

176
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,470
for flat earth, they all eventually find their
home, which is usually some other conspiracy

177
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,930
or anti-establishment narrative that ends
up doing a lot more damage, always just so

178
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,610
that some jerk can make a buck.

179
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,810
So while this seems to be the end of the road
for me with flat earth, as there truly is

180
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,973
just nothing left to say about it, perpetrators
of hoaxes in all other realms, prepare yourself.

181
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm coming.

182
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,380
Until next time.
