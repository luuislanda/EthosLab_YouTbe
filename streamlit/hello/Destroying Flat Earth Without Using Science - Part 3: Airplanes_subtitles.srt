00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:05,209
Hey everyone, so with the first two videos
in this miniseries, I demonstrated how anyone

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:09,480
can prove to themselves conclusively that
the earth is a sphere by looking at objects

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,209
in the sky and thinking with their brains.

4
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:15,790
Those objects were the moon, and the stars.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,789
So for this one, let’s get even simpler,
and talk about manmade objects in the sky.

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,810
That’s right, airplanes.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,210
Continuing with the theme of requiring precisely
zero science to show that flat earth is the

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,880
dumbest hoax on the entire internet, one thing
that anyone can do to prove the earth is a

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,340
sphere is to look at commercial airline flights.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,770
Let’s revisit the flat earth map, or the
thing they pretend isn’t their map, but

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,460
it totally is, because they can’t make a
map, so they just use this.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,080
Embarrassingly for them, this is actually
an azimuthal equidistant projection of the globe.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,840
That’s right, the flat earth map is a map
of the globe, taken from the perspective of

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,120
looking down at the north pole, and flattening
out its surface into a plane so that a three-dimensional

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,330
surface can be shown in two dimensions.

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,509
That’s why everything is distorted, with
no consistent scale.

17
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:11,009
Secretly, flat earth priests know what this
is, and they know it doesn’t work, but they’re

18
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,829
dumb and lazy and can’t come up with anything
better, so they stick with this and simply

19
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,990
deflect anytime these facts are brought up.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,900
Now, the further away from the center you
go, the more significant the distortion, so

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,609
problems really arise in the southern hemisphere.

22
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,090
That’s where the flights come in.

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,260
Here’s South America.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,710
Here’s Australia.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,060
Pretty far away, huh?

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,310
If this map was taken to be precisely to scale,
which it would be if the earth was actually

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,320
flat, then they’re as far away as two places
can get.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,829
Let’s say we wanted to fly between Santiago
and Sydney.

29
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,049
If the earth was flat, which way would we go?

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,200
Well the straight line path would go up across
all of South America, all of North America,

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,469
over Alaska, and then continuing all the way
until we get to Sydney.

32
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,789
So do any airlines actually fly between these cities?

33
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,229
Yes, they do.

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,950
This airline flies between Santiago and Sydney
four times a week.

35
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,070
But which way do they go?

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,770
Do they follow this straight line?

37
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,770
Nope.

38
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,910
They do the whole thing over the Pacific Ocean.

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,580
Here’s how that trip looks on a globe.

40
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,210
It takes 14 hours and 15 minutes going west,
and 12 hours and 25 minutes going east.

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,950
On a flat earth, that route would look like
this.

42
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,020
An absurdly long and totally unnecesary arc.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,270
For comparison, how long does it take to fly
between New York City and London?

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,320
It’s about 7 hours going east and about
8 hours going west.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,720
Now, you tell me.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,570
Does it make sense that a plane would travel
this enormous arc in less than twice the time

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,350
that it would take to travel this teeny tiny one?

48
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,010
Not even a little bit.

49
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,460
First of all, the fact that these are arcs
at all is totally nonsensical.

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,670
Planes don’t constantly turn slightly left or right.

51
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,410
They lock into a flight path and go straight.

52
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,840
Flat earthers like to whine about how planes
don’t constantly dip down to match the curvature

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,940
of the earth, but that’s because they have
no clue how planes work, since they maintain

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,530
constant altitude, and altitude conforms to
the curvature of the earth.

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,390
So, how do flat earthers deal with this information?

56
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,180
Well, for the longest time, they simply denied
that these southern hemisphere flights exist at all.

57
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,500
The flights are a nail in the coffin for flat
earth, so they would just lie and say there

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,560
aren’t any.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,900
But since anyone can find out that they definitely
do exist in about ten seconds of googling,

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,850
some of them have had to start coughing up explanations.

61
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,910
The most popular of these is to pretend that
the wind is responsible.

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,570
Again, this is because flat earthers are lazy.

63
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,780
Small differences in flight times going east
vs. west occur because planes fly with or

64
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,320
against wind currents.

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,020
So they just take this concept and bring it
to an absurd conclusion.

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,510
They will evoke currents of several hundred
miles per hour, which would be a world record

67
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,480
hurricane, and pretend that the plane is somehow
traveling twice as fast as usual without anyone noticing.

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,940
There are several problems here.

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,100
First of all, this boost from the imaginary
wind still isn’t anywhere near enough.

70
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,970
This arc is stupid long.

71
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,620
The plane would have to be going several thousand
miles per hour, and planes don’t do that.

72
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,720
Second, this flight goes both directions.

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,960
East and west.

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,859
How does the wind know which way the plane is going?

75
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,919
Most days there are planes going opposite
directions simultaneously.

76
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,409
Does each of them have a little personal tornado,
like in Wizard of Oz?

77
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:31,500
Flat earthers have suggested things as stupid
as personal domes such that everyone gets

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,289
their own set of stars, so sadly, this wouldn’t
even be the dumbest thing they’ve ever said.

79
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,099
But as you can see, there’s no way around this.

80
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,760
These flights exist.

81
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,069
They are not traveling this insane distance,
because this is a projection of the globe

82
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,129
without a consistent scale.

83
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,830
The problem with the projection map they push
as reality is that as we go towards the south

84
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,490
pole on a globe, the latitude lines are clearly
getting shorter and shorter.

85
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,051
But on this flat representation, they are
being represented as longer and longer, so

86
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,180
distances get more and more distorted the
further outwards you go.

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,719
That’s why pretending this is a real map
is stupid, and that’s why flat earth priests

88
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,289
pretend the southern hemisphere doesn’t exist.

89
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,760
It ruins everything for them.

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,551
As for their whining that flights don’t
travel over Antarctica, well, there’s no

91
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,070
reason for them to do that.

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,900
The shortest path, which we call a great circle,
for any common route doesn’t pass directly

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,029
over Antarctica.

94
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,220
Some get pretty close.

95
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,699
Like Johannesburg to Melbourne.

96
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,930
If it were to be flown, Johannesburg to Christchurch
would nick the edge of Antarctica.

97
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,770
But this isn’t a regular flight.

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,770
Why?

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,819
Because the latter isn’t a major city, so
not enough people would be interested in the

100
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,990
flight so as to make the route profitable
for an airline.

101
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,690
In fact, there are very few large cities in
the southern hemisphere in general.

102
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,909
Because of the way the continents are distributed
around the earth, 90% of the human population

103
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,930
lives in the northern hemisphere.

104
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,831
But much to the dismay of flat earth priests,
the southern hemisphere still exists, and

105
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:06,689
its existence is single-handedly enough to
make them cry like toddlers that found out

106
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:09,620
the easter bunny isn’t real.

107
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,949
So that’s it.

108
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,949
Airplanes.

109
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,810
Ask any airline pilot what the shape of the earth is.

110
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,379
When they’re done laughing at you, they’ll
tell you it’s a sphere.

111
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,419
And no, this moron doesn’t count.

112
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,509
He used to lie and say that he’s a commercial
pilot, but then he got exposed by a real pilot.

113
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,770
Then he tried to hide the fact that he lied
about it.

114
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,770
It was hilarious.

115
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,770
I’ll link to the video all about this incident
below, in case watching him accidentally prove

116
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,999
the earth is a rotating sphere on a Netflix
documentary wasn’t enough, and you want

117
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,960
to laugh some more at this stupid, hopeless moron.

118
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,099
To everyone else, I hope COVID ends real soon
so that we can all visit our favorite places

119
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,689
around the globe once more.

120
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:49,669
I’ll see you next time.
