00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,700
Hey everyone, so some of you may be aware
of my recent foray into the flat earth community,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,420
most notably with this lengthy response to
the Globebusters.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,860
For about two months now, the comments section
of that video has been a consistent hot bed

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,700
of activity, with hundreds of flat earthers
stopping by to share their opinions.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,250
Now for people who claim that “globetards”
just repeat what they were told in school,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,060
you guys sure do all say the exact same things.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,000
And I don’t just mean the same arguments,
I mean the same things word for word, as though

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,910
it was copied and pasted from some manifesto.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,370
This is because you all watch the same ridiculous
youtube videos made by the same handful of

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,230
con men, and you all quote them verbatim without
applying a shred of critical thinking.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,019
So now, after becoming intimately familiar
with your “greatest hits”, I just had

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:52,819
to do one more video sharing the ten things
that all flat earthers say.

13
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,730
If you’re a regular person and you haven’t
seen my other two flat earth videos, you may

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,829
want to check those out first for a little
context.

15
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:04,269
But if you are a flat earther yourself then
don’t bother, I’ll be speaking directly

16
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,520
to you throughout this video.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,800
Let’s begin.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Number one.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,690
One extremely problematic side effect of taking
the globe and flattening it out into a plane

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,210
is that gravity makes no sense, and there
is no reason for things to fall to the ground.

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,190
All objects accelerate towards the ground
at 9.8 meters per second squared.

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,840
That’s an indisputable fact, and it is also
an indisputable fact that any acceleration

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
requires a force to produce it.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,520
This is how cars drive, planes fly, people
walk, cats jump, it’s how literally all

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,260
motion works.

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,210
Even charlatans like the globebusters accept
at least this much, which is why they go off

27
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,840
on their rants about magnetic magic, as you
may have seen in my previous video.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,440
But quite comically, most flat earthers don’t
even do this.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,090
Most of you address this problem by simply
listing two words.

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,500
Density, and buoyancy.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,660
Well, I hate to break it to you guys, but
these are not forces.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,710
Forces are vectors.

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,230
They have a magnitude, which means a numerical
amount, and a direction, which means they

34
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,040
have to point somewhere.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,439
Density is simply mass per unit volume, or
how much matter sits in a particular space.

36
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,569
It doesn’t point anywhere.

37
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,260
And buoyancy is simply a measurement of an
object’s tendency to float.

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,060
So allow me to repeat.

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,040
THESE ARE NOT FORCES.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,629
This is trivial to prove.

41
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:26,750
You say that objects fall down because they
are more dense than the air below them.

42
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,890
Why down?

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,939
Why not up?

44
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,090
Or sideways?

45
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,950
When you let go of a ball, there is air all
around it.

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,959
How does it know to fall down?

47
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,469
Also, objects fall down when they are in a
vacuum, which means there is no air below

48
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,469
them.

49
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,700
What’s happening there?

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,150
Face the facts.

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,030
Things accelerate down towards the ground
because of a downward force.

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,390
That force is gravity, which pulls everything
towards the center of the earth, which is

53
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,230
its center of mass.

54
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,420
Denser things displace less dense things because
gravity exists.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,049
More mass means a greater gravitational attraction.

56
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,450
This is clearly why things that are less dense
than water float on water, again because gravity

57
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,450
exists.

58
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,249
Rocks are pulled down harder than water, which
is pulled down harder than air.

59
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:16,810
Some of your more popular retorts to this
include wondering how oceans stay on the earth

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,269
while birds and insects can fly.

61
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,249
It’s because birds and insects have wings.

62
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,019
They flap them and generate an upward force.

63
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,930
If that force exceeds the gravitational force,
they go up.

64
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,409
Oceans can’t do this, because oceans don’t
have wings.

65
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,249
Individual water molecules can evaporate and
go up into the sky because they are so, so,

66
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,370
so tiny.

67
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,919
But when they get up to where it is colder
and accumulate into clouds, they eventually

68
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,379
condense back into liquid water, and guess
what happens?

69
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,530
They fall back down as rain.

70
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,909
Hopefully you are familiar with rain.

71
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,849
As for planes and other macroscopic objects,
again, they go up only when a force is applied.

72
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,639
When you throw a ball up into the sky, the
force imparted on the ball by your arm is

73
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,260
greater than the gravitational force, but
as soon as it leaves your hand, no more force

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,239
is being applied, and only the gravitational
force is acting upon the ball, so that velocity

75
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,269
gets smaller and smaller, hits zero, at which
point it starts to fall, and it falls faster

76
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,829
and faster until it hits the ground.

77
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,919
Gravity.

78
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,109
Gravity exists.

79
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,299
Period.

80
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,160
Saying it is “just a theory” does nothing
but display that you have no idea what a theory

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
is.

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,130
Stop repeating what you hear on flat earth
videos, and catch up to the 17th century.

83
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,130
Number two.

84
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,360
Flat earthers all say “I shouldn’t see
this thing, but I do, so the earth is flat.”

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,750
Then to justify this claim, you all say the
same thing, typically with no context whatsoever.

86
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,120
8 inches per mile squared.

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,220
None of you have any idea what this means.

88
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,410
You can’t derive it.

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,130
You can’t calculate anything with it.

90
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,990
You can’t make a prediction with it.

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,570
You can’t tell me anything about this value
at all.

92
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,930
When I point this out to you, you get very
angry, and instead of answering simple questions,

93
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,830
you just link me to a bunch of videos made
by con men.

94
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,570
Well I’m sorry friends, those people are
doing incorrect math, or lying, or both, and

95
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,090
they are counting on the fact that you won’t
do any math at all to check up on them.

96
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,419
8 inches per mile squared is not a valid way
to measure earth’s curvature.

97
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,980
If you understood math, you would immediately
see that this “squared” on miles is totally

98
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,039
out of place.

99
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,139
That’s because this is a parabolic approximation.

100
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,770
This is for doing calculations with a parabola.

101
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,410
It’s possible that you remember this shape
from middle school algebra, but I wouldn’t

102
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,340
be surprised if you don’t.

103
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,659
As you can see, the earth is not shaped like
this.

104
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,479
So where does it come from, and why do people
use it?

105
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,920
It comes from the flat earth bible, Zetetic
Astronomy, and flat earth priests use it because

106
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,270
they know it’s not accurate.

107
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,690
It gives them incorrect values that they can
use to claim that they shouldn’t be able

108
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,520
to see something, when in fact they totally
should.

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,780
There are dozens of videos on youtube demonstrating
this, several of which reference the actual

110
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,229
formula that actually describes earth’s
curvature, which as you can see requires trigonometry.

111
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,210
Stop blindly repeating what you hear on flat
earth videos, and learn some basic math so

112
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,669
that you can do these calculations for yourself.

113
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:11,669
Number three.

114
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,750
All flat earthers say the same two things
about water.

115
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,949
The first is “water doesn’t curve”,
and the second is “water finds its own level”.

116
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,610
The second phrase is completely meaningless,
so the fact that you all say that exact thing

117
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,699
verbatim is just one of the many demonstrations
that you all blindly repeat what you hear

118
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,949
without giving it a moment’s thought.

119
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,180
As for the first phrase, stating that water
doesn’t curve is at least a coherent thought,

120
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,009
however, it is dead wrong.

121
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,880
Put a drop of water on a piece of wax paper,
or a leaf.

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,229
What does it look like?

123
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,759
A freaking sphere!

124
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,410
Isn’t that something?

125
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,259
In your haste to mindlessly parrot what you
heard from flat earth priests about water,

126
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,349
you forgot to look at water.

127
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,969
Water curves, my friends.

128
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,729
Look at this curved meniscus.

129
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,199
Look at these waves.

130
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,389
Water curves all the time.

131
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,389
Water is not magic.

132
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,300
It is subject to influence by external forces
just like all other matter.

133
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,980
With a spherical water droplet, that’s the
electromagnetic force.

134
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,819
Water molecules make hydrogen bonds with one
another, which in this context we refer to

135
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,360
as cohesive forces.

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,550
That’s why water has a very high surface
tension.

137
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,650
And that’s why a water droplet remains spherical,
so that it can maximize the number of hydrogen

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,150
bonds that are formed, and keep the system
at the lowest energy possible.

139
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,570
So clearly and indisputably, water curves.

140
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,190
In this example it is due to the electromagnetic
force.

141
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,669
It is therefore quite easy to understand that
it can curve under the influence of any force.

142
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:36,720
Including gravity.

143
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,629
The oceans conform to the curvature of the
earth just like the land does, and for the

144
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,760
same reason.

145
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,689
This is why saying that “water finds its
own level” is absolutely meaningless.

146
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,030
You think that level means flat, as though
on the globe model, water should just magically

147
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,070
project into space at some arbitrary angle.

148
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,070
In fact, level just means as close to the
center of the earth as possible.

149
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:03,610
What’s most hilarious is that even in the
tool called the level, which only works because

150
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,560
gravity exists, there is a curved bubble right
in there.

151
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,560
If the bubble is curved, what is the liquid,
which is mostly water, doing around that bubble?

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
It curves!

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,780
It is absolutely astonishing how the things
you repeat from flat earth videos are incompatible

154
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,689
with even the most trivial every day observations.

155
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,060
You should acknowledge that.

156
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Number four.

157
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,419
You are all quite perplexed about how earth’s
atmosphere can exist next to the vacuum of

158
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,419
space.

159
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,190
This one is rather amusing, because what’s
happening is that since you have no science

160
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,850
education, your only context for the word
vacuum is a vacuum cleaner.

161
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,930
And again, because you have no science education,
none of you understand how a vacuum cleaner

162
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,290
works, which is a problem, because you seem
to think that outer space is a vacuum cleaner.

163
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,730
Let’s take a moment and clear this up.

164
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,060
A vacuum is any region where there is no stuff.

165
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,420
Here there is stuff.

166
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Like air.

167
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,990
In space, there is no stuff, or at least very
very close to no stuff.

168
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,480
Space is essentially empty.

169
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
That’s a vacuum.

170
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,610
It is not a thing that sucks.

171
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,640
Vacuums don’t suck.

172
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,210
Everyone say it with me together.

173
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,589
Vacuums don’t suck.

174
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:17,190
Earth’s atmosphere displays a gradient because
gravity exists.

175
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,140
There’s a lot of atmosphere right near the
ground, and then as you rise, because fewer

176
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,329
and fewer molecules will have enough kinetic
energy to go so high, it gets thinner and

177
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,690
thinner and thinner until there’s none left.

178
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,940
Then you’re in space.

179
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,750
It’s that simple.

180
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,820
Number five.

181
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,610
One of your favorite little “gotcha” challenges,
is to request that we demonstrate how water

182
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,149
can stick to a ball spinning at a thousand
miles per hour.

183
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,300
The implication is that water and everything
else should fly off of it, like a child getting

184
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,200
thrown from a merry-go-round.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,950
Well it’s very cute that you get overwhelmed
by numbers with four digits in them, but in

186
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,930
actuality the earth spins once per day.

187
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,350
One time in twenty four hours.

188
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,040
Get on a merry-go-round and have someone push
you one time around over twenty four hours.

189
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,269
Not a very thrilling ride, is it?

190
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,790
The issue is that the earth is really really
big.

191
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,220
So if instead of using rotational velocity
to describe a rotating body, like a normal

192
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,890
person, you try to use linear tangential velocity,
you’re gonna get a pretty big number.

193
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,829
But to be honest, it’s still not really
that big.

194
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,730
Planes go more than half that speed, and sitting
on a plane at cruising altitude with no turbulence

195
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,110
is just like sitting on a chair on the ground.

196
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,709
Flat earth priests cite these big velocities
associated with the earth and the solar system

197
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:37,680
purely for shock value, and you’re falling
for it.

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop doing that.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,010
Furthermore, this little “water doesn’t
stick to a ball” challenge is the strawiest

200
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,779
straw man that was ever made of straw.

201
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,420
The earth is huge.

202
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,029
It generates an enormous gravitational field.

203
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,839
That’s why everything sticks to it.

204
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,470
A ball is very tiny.

205
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,190
It does not generate an enormous gravitational
field, so things don’t stick to it.

206
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,240
Also, unless you’re doing this in space,
the ball must be very close to the earth,

207
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,160
which as we just said, generates an enormous
gravitational field.

208
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,990
So when water drips off the ball onto the
ground, your desired demonstration of gravity

209
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,580
fails because gravity exists.

210
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,380
Stop asking for ridiculous and impossible
demonstrations, like having to build an earth-sized

211
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,449
object to show you how water sticks to something
as big as the earth.

212
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:26,460
Number six.

213
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,290
Lots of you say that moonlight is cold.

214
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,790
This is astonishing for a number of reasons.

215
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,720
The first is that it is not related to any
claim you could possibly be making in order

216
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,400
to argue for a flat earth.

217
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,890
But the second, and much more important detail,
is that it is the perfect demonstration of

218
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,800
the fact that you have no clue how science
works.

219
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,270
Some flat earth priest measured the temperature
under the moonlight, and then again under

220
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,149
something providing shade.

221
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,149
Wow!

222
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,150
Moonlight makes it colder!

223
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,150
But does it?

224
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,750
Shouldn’t you add some element of control
to your experiment?

225
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,060
What’s a control you ask?

226
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
Fair question.

227
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,709
You see, your measurement isn’t evidence
of anything.

228
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,279
You now have to repeat the experiment when
there is no moonlight to make sure that the

229
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,680
moonlight was indeed the cause of the discrepancy
in temperature.

230
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,740
This is something you should have learned
in middle school, but don’t worry, I’ll

231
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,480
finish the experiment for you.

232
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,430
Take the measurements again on a night with
a new moon, so that there is no moonlight.

233
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,430
Look at that!

234
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,310
You’ll get the same result.

235
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,980
So the moonlight absolutely wasn’t the reason
for the discrepancy in temperature.

236
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,160
What was the reason?

237
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,520
Well that thing that is providing the shade
from the moonlight is also trapping in heat

238
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,680
that is emanating from the earth while it
faces away from the sun.

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,390
So, case closed.

240
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,329
I’ll link to at least one empirical demonstration
of this fact in the description below.

241
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:44,649
See how important it is to know how to do
a science experiment?

242
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,320
Maybe you should actually learn science, rather
than just repeating what you hear on flat

243
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,290
earth videos.

244
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,320
Number seven.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,920
Many of you say some unintelligible nonsense
about water flowing uphill, or that on the

246
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,850
globe model, some rivers flow uphill.

247
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,430
This one is so stupid that I genuinely can’t
believe any human could fall for it.

248
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,579
You’ll look at a globe and say that a river
flows this way, and that this is somehow uphill,

249
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,860
because you seem to think that up on the screen
is some kind of universal up in space.

250
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,290
Well how about if I turn this a little bit?

251
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,290
What do you know!

252
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,709
Now it’s down.

253
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:19,709
Listen up.

254
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,600
There is no up and down in space.

255
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,920
This is not up.

256
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,150
This is not down.

257
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,160
To believe so would be as dumb as thinking
that on earth, whichever way you happen to

258
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
be facing is north.

259
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,920
No one on earth is upside down, or on their
side.

260
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,509
Up on earth is away from the surface of the
earth, no matter where you are on the earth.

261
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:45,839
Rivers flow from higher elevation to lower
elevation, which is a measure of how far away

262
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,829
you are from the surface of the earth.

263
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,670
This has nothing to do with flowing in any
particular direction along the surface.

264
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,529
This is also why people who make videos acting
confused about why elevation doesn’t change

265
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,019
between various sea level locations around
the world, are among the dumbest people alive.

266
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,350
This is sea level.

267
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,480
This is sea level.

268
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,959
This is above sea level.

269
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,160
This is above sea level.

270
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,280
That’s what elevation means.

271
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,339
Learn the definitions of words before you
try to use them in a sentence.

272
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:16,430
Number eight.

273
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,730
Many flat earthers remain dumbfounded by the
idea that the earth is slightly closer to

274
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,839
the sun in winter than in summer.

275
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,180
As I’ve said before, winter up north is
summer down south, and vice versa.

276
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,880
So your confusion is one of northern hemisphere
narcisissm.

277
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,010
But it is also one of complete ignorance.

278
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,170
Here’s the earth.

279
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,390
Here’s the light coming from the sun.

280
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,410
Look at this portion.

281
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,100
It hits the earth straight on.

282
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,190
Look at this portion.

283
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,560
Because of the curvature of the earth, the
light hits the surface at an angle, and is

284
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,440
therefore distributed around a greater area.

285
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,569
Same amount of heat distributed around a larger
area, lower average temperature.

286
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,639
This is absolutely trivial to understand.

287
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,060
It’s why magnifying glasses can focus light
to a point and set things on fire.

288
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,199
It’s how heat works.

289
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,970
Flat earth priests know this, they just pretend
to be confused about things that they know

290
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,800
their viewers won’t check up on.

291
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Number nine.

292
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,420
Many flat earthers refer to the body of scientific
knowledge as “scientism”.

293
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,660
This is meant to be derogatory, implying that
science is a religion.

294
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,500
I’m very sorry, but saying this just demonstrates
that you know nothing about science, and probably

295
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,329
didn’t pass a single science class in high
school.

296
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,500
Science students are not told what to believe.

297
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,690
They are shown how to perform experiments.

298
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,370
Even in high school physics, students use
blocks and ramps and balls and pendulums and

299
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,459
carts and rulers and timers to derive Newton’s
laws and many other such pillars of science.

300
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,920
They personally do the science that has already
been done by others in order to derive the

301
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,300
knowledge that we already know, and prove
its validity to themselves.

302
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,370
This continues through college, and then on
into graduate school, where students do their

303
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,310
own research and figure out things that no
one else has done yet.

304
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:01,160
So using the word scientism only serves to
disqualify you from adult conversation regarding

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
science.

306
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,120
In actuality, it is quite clear why you adopt
this viewpoint.

307
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,000
Because you just accept whatever you hear
if it’s what you want to believe.

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,339
This is why your beliefs are baseless.

309
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,910
Since you are incapable of doing anything
other than repeating what you are told, you

310
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,360
assume that others are doing the same thing.

311
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,540
But they are not.

312
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,459
Those that are educated in the sciences understand
how things work, and use this information

313
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:29,009
to build technology, such as computers and
the internet, both of which you use to claim

314
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,250
that the science that produced them isnt real,
in a display of irony so thick that you could

315
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,350
cut it with a knife.

316
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,629
And to wrap things up, number ten.

317
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,589
The piece de resistance.

318
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,379
The claim that we have all been indoctrinated.

319
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:49,620
That we have been brainwashed, by schools,
by the government, by NASA, by freemasons,

320
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,700
by Hollywood.

321
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Take your pick.

322
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,320
Well, as I have demonstrated in this clip,
you all say the same exact ridiculous things

323
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,029
word for word, like you’re reciting the
oath of the flat earth fraternity, so it’s

324
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,200
a rather silly accusation to be throwing around.

325
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,730
The fact that you all say the same things
is not surprising in the slighest.

326
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,819
What do you do when you want to brainwash
someone?

327
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:15,140
You tell them they have already been brainwashed.

328
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,809
That’s what flat earth priests do.

329
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,459
They tell you that you’ve been brainwashed
so that you are nice and receptive to the

330
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,459
brainwashing.

331
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,900
They tell you that everything you know is
a lie so that they can lie to you.

332
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,620
It’s human psychology 101.

333
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,940
Why do they do this?

334
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Money.

335
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Status.

336
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,050
It’s a way for con men to capitalize on
the gullible few who exhibit a combination

337
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,740
of ignorance and suggestibility.

338
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,400
It’s a cult.

339
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
You’re part of a cult.

340
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,580
Not like the “kill yourselves with kool-aid”
kind, but it’s not that far off.

341
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,100
So get angry, call me a shill, call me whatever
you want.

342
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,220
I guarantee that many of you will attempt
to bring up these ten things I just talked

343
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,770
about while commenting on this very video,
having not even watched any of it.

344
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,020
Most of the rest will avoid addressing anything
I said and just vomit a bunch of other, different

345
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,690
flat earth talking points.

346
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,230
But hopefully a small handful of you will
have the courage to accept that you’ve fallen

347
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,230
for a hoax.

348
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,840
It’s not that big a deal.

349
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,400
Many of us have fallen for hoaxes or been
manipulated at one time or another, myself

350
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
included.

351
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,390
Just admit it to yourself and walk away.

352
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,640
And when you’re ready to learn science in
earnest, my tutorials will be waiting you.

353
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,559
Thanks for watching.
