00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:01,539
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:05,399
So there’s been a resurgence of interest
in my channel among flat earthers lately.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,420
First, there’s this intellectual powerhouse...

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,020
who tried to debunk my ten things that all

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,360
flat earthers say by repeating the ten things
that all flat earthers say.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,010
Great work, slick.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,590
Then the globebusters, no doubt still upset
about my video that exposed their unparalleled

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,070
stupidity to millions of people, which continues
to get between ten and twenty thousand views

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:36,010
per day, are publishing feature length responses
made by some nitwit to my ten challenges,

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,270
which literally do not respond to the challenges.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,190
I ask for a map, 90 minutes later, I kid you
not, no map.

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,620
So with the dwindling flat earth cult now
a pathetic parody of itself, I’m just going

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,400
to do a few more videos demonstrating how
easy it is to destroy flat earth without using

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,510
any science at all.

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,010
Last time we looked at the moon, so today,
let’s look at the stars.

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,390
Flat earthers love to complain about how dumb
it is to look up at the sky to determine the

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,110
shape of the earth, but that’s only because
doing so specifically proves that it’s a

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,100
sphere, and it’s one of the ways we figured
out that it’s a sphere thousands of years ago.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,780
For example, if you’re at a northernly latitude
facing northwards and you watch the stars

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,380
for a while, you will notice that they appear
to rotate counterclockwise around a point

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,450
in the sky.

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,860
This point is roughly aligned with the star
Polaris, which we call the north star.

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,610
If you were to then travel south for a while,
you would see that certain stars are no longer

24
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,120
viewable, and at the equator, all the stars
move directly east to west through the sky.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,330
Then, heading towards the southernly latitudes
and facing south, you will see a whole new

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,450
batch of stars you couldn’t see in the north,
and they will again be rotating around a point

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,420
in the sky, though this time clockwise instead
of counterclockwise.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,049
So, how do we make sense of these observations?

29
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,799
Do they work on a flat earth?

30
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,310
Not even a little bit.

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,880
That the sky would be doing different things
for different people just because they are

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,450
standing closer or further from the center
of a disk is total nonsense.

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,269
That’s why flat earthers avoid this subject
all together, unless they have the balls to

34
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:16,969
invent idiotic sorcery like personal domes
and other fantasies that are not even worth

35
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:17,969
deconstructing.

36
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:23,040
Furthermore, why can’t people towards the
outer edge see the same stars as people towards

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,129
the center?

38
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,129
And vice versa?

39
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,749
What’s blocking the light?

40
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,659
Again, no explanation.

41
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,139
Now what would happen on a sphere that is
turning?

42
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,510
Standing up north, whichever point in the
sky is aligned with the rotational axis would

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,809
appear not to move, and everything else would
rotate around it.

44
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:42,329
Just like we see.

45
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,669
Standing in the south, same thing, but the
opposite direction from their perspective.

46
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:52,219
Also, any star that would require a line of
sight that cuts through the earth is not visible,

47
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,260
because we can’t see through the earth.

48
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,019
That’s why southerners can’t see Polaris,
and northerners can’t see the Southern Cross.

49
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,040
But that’s not all, literally all observations
of the sky from the southern hemisphere are

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,769
utterly inexplicable on the flat earth.

51
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,549
Consider people standing towards the southern
tips of South America, Africa, and Australia.

52
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,120
They all can see the Southern Cross when they
look south, and two of them at a time can

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,010
even see it simultaneously, depending on the
time of night.

54
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,219
Does that make any sense with these folks
all looking in completely different directions?

55
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,749
None whatsoever.

56
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:32,579
Come to think of it, what does “south”
even mean on a flat earth?

57
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,499
It’s totally nonsensical.

58
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:39,540
But again, on a sphere, south actually means
something, and all these people are looking

59
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,389
in the same direction, towards the south celestial pole.

60
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,650
So they can all see the same sky, no problem.

61
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,879
Now, most flat earthers have heard all of
this before, and instead of admitting to themselves

62
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,089
that the logic is airtight, they just ignore
all of it, and bring up unrelated objectively

63
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,120
incorrect talking points.

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,530
At least a thousand times I’ve been asked
why the stars don’t change throughout the

65
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,659
year if we are orbiting the sun.

66
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,980
Well, they do.

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,430
The stars that lie near the ecliptic are obscured
half the year, because they are on the other

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,800
side of the sun, and we can’t see stars
during the daytime because of how bright the sun is.

69
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,140
These are the zodiac constellations, the ones
from astrology, so it’s shocking that you’re

70
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,500
not familiar with them, since you’re so
in love with pseudoscience.

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,060
The stars that can be viewed in a direction
closer to perpendicular to the ecliptic are

72
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,560
seen throughout the year, and there’s no
logical basis for thinking that they wouldn’t be.

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
They’re really far away.

74
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,030
Earth’s orbital radius is negligible in comparison.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,750
But because of earth’s orbit, they do shift
their positions slightly throughout the year.

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,370
It’s called stellar parallax.

77
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,750
I would link to my tutorial that explains
what that is, but I know learning is not really

78
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,750
your thing.

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,070
Eh, here it is anyway.

80
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,720
Give it a look if you’re feeling bold.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
So that’s it.

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,180
Once again, looking at the sky with your eyeballs
is all you need to do to demonstrate that

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,810
the earth is a sphere.

84
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,280
And once again, that’s how the ancients
figured out that the earth is a sphere, without

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,100
having a clue about literally anything else.

86
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,420
They thought astrology was true, and that
demons are real, and yet, they got this one down.

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,060
If you can’t manage that, you’re allergic
to thinking, and there’s no point in talking to you.

88
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,100
To everyone else, see you next time.
