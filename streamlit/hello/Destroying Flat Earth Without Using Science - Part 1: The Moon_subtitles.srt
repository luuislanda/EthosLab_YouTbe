00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,730
Hey everyone, so you may remember the 10 challenges
I offered to flat earthers a couple months

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,420
ago, and it’s been very amusing watching
them run around like chickens with their heads

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,770
cut off, making pathetic response videos where
they puff up their chests and bark at each

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,029
other for hours without actually responding
to any of the challenges.

5
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:21,310
Memorizing the names of logical fallacies
and shouting them at random sure seems like

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,919
a lot of fun, but it’s not a working map,
or a model that shows the seasons with night

7
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:30,890
and day, or a legitimate response to anything
whatsoever, so at this point I think it’s

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,630
safe to say that they’ve thrown in the towel.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,660
Of course there is no need to follow up after
such an annihilation, and I did not intend

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,460
to, but now I find myself quarantined because
of the coronavirus, with no access to YouTube

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,280
studios and no way to make my regular content.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,540
So, you lucky little flerfballs, I’m back for more.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,690
Here’s what’s going to happen now.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,170
Since my 10 challenges made your heads explode,
and none of you have the mental capacity to

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,360
make a map or a model, even at a middle school
level, I figured I would dumb it down for

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
you even more.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,740
It’s very easy to think of things that single-handedly
obliterate the flat earth delusion, like say,

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,299
the existence of gravity.

19
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,720
But you are so thoroughly science illiterate
that you just shout “gravity doesn’t exist”,

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,850
and pretend that this is not a stupid thing to say.

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,369
So instead, let’s try some proofs that have
nothing to do with science at all.

22
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,859
There is no challenge, there is no preqrequisite
information, you just have to listen, acknowledge

23
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,210
that the logic is air tight, and then cry
yourself to sleep.

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,210
Are you ready?

25
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,240
Here comes one now.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,310
What is this object?

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,679
It’s the moon.

28
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,770
We’ve all seen the moon.

29
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,009
We’ve seen it many times.

30
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,740
Look at all of these pictures of the moon.

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,039
What do they have in common?

32
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,469
They all show precisely the same features.

33
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,880
We all see the same face of the moon.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,899
It doesn’t change from night to night, and
it doesn’t change throughout the night.

35
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,490
There is no denying this.

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,170
You can’t shout CGI.

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,569
You can’t cry conspiracy.

38
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:57,960
It’s the moon.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,670
We can all see it with our own eyeballs.

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,310
It’s there, and it always looks like this.

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,779
Now let’s place the moon above a flat disk
and let it float around in the little magic

42
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,569
circles you like to imagine.

43
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,690
If the earth was flat, would we all see the
same face of the moon?

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,470
Here is someone standing in one spot looking
at the moon.

45
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,810
They see this.

46
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,379
Here is someone standing in another spot looking
at the same moon.

47
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,970
They see this too.

48
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,150
And this person.

49
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,420
And this person.

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,709
You get the idea.

51
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,540
So is this possible?

52
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,700
No, because that’s not how objects work.

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,200
People on the opposite sides of an object
can’t see the same face of the object.

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,310
Go get two of your little buddies and have
them stand on opposite sides of you.

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,069
Can they both see the front of your face at once?

56
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,069
No.

57
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,030
A spherical moon over a flat earth is not
consistent with reality.

58
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,319
At all.

59
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,069
So is it two-dimensional, with the same face
on both sides?

60
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,180
Then anyone but these two people would see
a different shape.

61
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,269
So no.

62
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,680
Is it pointing down like a spotlight?

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,819
Then it would change shape as it passes by,
and only appear circular when directly overhead.

64
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,140
So no.

65
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,650
Is there any way we can make this work on
a flat earth?

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,540
No.

67
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,620
There is not.

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,160
So how, pray tell, do all people see the same
face of the moon?

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,260
Because earth is a sphere, and the moon goes
around the earth.

70
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,629
It is tidally locked with the earth, with
one face always pointing towards the earth.

71
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:35,020
That’s why everyone sees the same face of
the moon, and that’s the ONLY way that everyone

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,290
can see the same face of the moon.

73
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,290
And guess what?

74
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,769
The direction the moon is pointing even correlates
with the observer’s latitude.

75
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,409
Isn’t that something?

76
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,950
Whether at the north pole, south pole, or
anywhere in between, the orientation of the

77
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,390
face of the moon that we all see, will reveal
your latitude on the spherical earth.

78
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,450
Pretty neat, huh?

79
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,849
Maybe one day you’ll save up enough allowance
that you can leave your mom’s basement and

80
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,720
see the moon from another part of the world.

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,439
So, my precious little learners, do you now
see how pathetically fragile the flat earth

82
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,519
delusion is?

83
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,740
Of all the hundreds of individual, isolated
phenomena that debunk it to shreds like it

84
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,819
was made of papier mache, some of them don’t
even require an ounce of scientific knowledge.

85
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,680
They just require that you are able to think
with your brain for five full seconds.

86
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,900
For today’s conclusive proof, we didn’t
have to talk about physics, or astronomy,

87
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,120
or space travel.

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,650
We didn’t have to do any math.

89
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,530
There were no equations for you to misunderstand,
or numbers for you to lie about.

90
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,039
We just did a little bit of critical thinking.

91
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,340
So now you can see how people figured out
that the earth is round thousands of years

92
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,259
ago, before science even existed.

93
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,630
Because they weren’t stupid.

94
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,880
They had access to basic logic, and were able
to comprehend simple proofs like this one,

95
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,770
of which there are dozens.

96
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,500
Just like you, they didn’t know anything
about gravity, or forces, or cosmology.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,310
And just like you, they had no idea what the
moon is, or what the sun is, or what the stars

98
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,030
are, and they figured it out all the same.

99
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,880
Because they didn’t have to know what these
objects are.

100
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,479
They just had fully functional brains and
a basic capacity for spatial reasoning.

101
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,569
So before you go and spew some emoji-laden
nonsense in the comments section, take a moment

102
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,680
to reflect and admit to yourself that what
we talked about here today is irrefutable.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,300
There is no way around it.

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,830
Your usual whining about conspiracies and
CGI have no place here.

105
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,300
There is no science for you to blatantly deny.

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,800
It’s just basic logic that even a toddler
could understand.

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,240
If you can’t wrap your head around this,
there truly is no hope for you.

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,840
So take a deep breath, let the facts in, and
push the delusion out.

109
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,289
Have a nice day.
