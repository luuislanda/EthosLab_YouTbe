00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
[Dave] Hey everyone, this is gonna be a pretty
different video from what I normally post.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
If you're from the Flat Earth realm,
you know what this is about.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,120
If you're one of my regular viewers,
I'll fill you in as quickly as possible.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,020
Last week, I posted video about how we know the Earth isn't flat.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,760
This was really just to reinforce and contextualize
some lessons from earlier in my astronomy  playlist.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,040
I figured I'd get a few trolls, nothing major.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,620
But instead, the entirety of the Flat Earth community descended upon it with a vengeance.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,660
The YouTube channel Globebusters
informed me, that they were going to be

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,880
deconstructing my video in their weekly live stream,
and they invited me to check it out.

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,420
I didn't really know what to expect, I thought
there'd be some degree of dialogue or exchange.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,520
There definitely wasn't. Everything they were saying

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,360
I was discrediting in real time,
and they were acknowledging none of it.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,860
On top of that, they were extremely rude to me,

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,060
so I had to respond simply as a point of honor.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,640
And that's this, so let's begin.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,220
I'll start with the only valid criticism you had of me,

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,700
and that is that I misrepresented your model and didn't research it enough.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,980
You're right, I didn't look up almost anything you believe.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,040
But now, that you've told me so many of the
things, that you do believe – even better!

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
Let's go through how all of them are wrong.

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,380
Since I botched your model so horribly,
let's go straight to yours.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,300
This is the one you showed me to explain the seasons.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,500
It attempts to account for the temperature differential throughout the year.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,100
But I'm sorry, it's not compatible with observation. Here's why.

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,900
These are the two tropics. I don't know
what you think these circumferences are,

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,780
but it's safe to say, that this one is smaller than this one.

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,880
If that's the case, one of two things must be true.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,220
Option 1: this object maneuvers the inner path

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,040
in a shorter amount of time,
than it maneuvers the outer path.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,840
Which would make summer shorter than winter. It's not.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,600
Option 2: it moves much slower up here
and much faster down here,

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,260
so that all of the circles take the same amount of time.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,140
That would mean the Sun moves through the sky at different speeds throughout the year.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,900
It doesn't! So sorry, this model doesn't work.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Now let's go to the one you showed me for night and day.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,220
We all know, that precisely half the Earth is experiencing day,

37
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,080
and the other half is experiencing night at any given time.

38
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,060
So your model must reflect that, and this one does,

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,000
but at the cost of being even remotely reasonable.

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
You've got the Sun illuminating half this surface

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,580
with an arbitrary and rigidly straight line down the middle.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,680
How does this work?

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,480
How does light leave this object,
and travel one distance to stop here,

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,720
and travel some totally different distance, to stop over here?

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,120
You guys love to talk about refraction and such things.

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,240
So please, explain how that works!

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,120
And that's not the only problem.

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,340
Here, you've got the Sun and Moon always opposite each other.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
Well, sometimes we can see
the Sun and Moon at the same time.

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,880
How does that work? What is an eclipse?

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,020
When in this model does the Moon get under the Sun to block it?

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,380
How do they get on opposite sides of the Earth for a lunar eclipse?

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,880
If the Sun is very, very close,
and is also the source of all our heat,

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,260
why doesn't it get hotter, when you
go up towards it in elevation?

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,300
None of it works.

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,640
We've barely even started, but let's review.

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,060
We are trying to explain just two phenomena: seasons, and night and day.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,820
To do this, you have two different models,
both of which are incompatible with observation.

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,600
But furthermore, they are incompatible with each other.

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,900
Why can't you even attempt to explain both
of these phenomena at the same time?

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Going back to your day and night model: it's weird,

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,460
because you said that the Sun moves between the tropics.

63
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,240
Why isn't that shown here?
Because, if you did show that,

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,520
you'd also have to change something about how far the light reaches,

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,000
which would make this already absurd graphic even more absurd.

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,460
Then, if we go back to the one for the seasons, why can't you show the dark half and light half while showing this?

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,800
It's deliberately not shown, because
it would be obviously inconsistent.

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,860
Therein lies the problem with the Flat Earth model: you don't have one.

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,740
You can't even explain two phenomena with the same model!

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,060
The globe model has no problem doing this.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,540
This ball spins, so the half facing the Sun
is day and the other half is night.

72
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,760
As it goes around the Sun, the hemisphere receiving more direct sunlight experiences summer.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,080
The one with less experiences winter.

74
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,500
That's right, sorry to burst your bubble.
It doesn't correlate with the distance from the Sun.

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,680
Sunlight shining directly on the ground,
more energy per square mile, hotter.

76
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,160
Sunlight at an angle to the ground, same amount
of energy distributed around a greater area, cooler.

77
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,220
And there it is, both the seasons and day and night

78
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,940
are explained immaculately,
and go figure, simultaneously!

79
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,900
Honestly, I could stop right here.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,900
If you were to respond to this with anything other than a model,

81
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,740
that can explain at least those first two observations simultaneously,

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,820
your viewers should find that very indicative of the fact, that you don't have one.

83
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,320
But while we're here, let's go through
a few dozen more key points.

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,700
Given that we're on the subject of models,

85
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,240
let's hit the one you use for your
explanation of the Coriolis effect.

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,040
[Globebusters] You can kind of draw a, um...

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,360
...clockwise orbit, Bob, in the middle there.

88
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,020
And you can see how, that this would cause... there you go, you know.

89
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,460
If the Sun and Moon are moving in this, and you know,

90
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,100
they're diamagnetic, and pushing water, causing tides.

91
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,140
And then you've also got these winds,
that uh... and storms that would, you know, uh...

92
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,920
...have to be, what the Sun and Moon would cause.

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,260
[Dave] "Would have to be"?
How? You haven't explained anything!

94
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,940
So the Sun pushes water to get the air currents,
and the Moon pulls water to get the tides?

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,900
Also, does the Sun push the atmosphere in one direction to the right,

96
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,120
and magically in the other direction to the left?

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,380
What about storm rotation, which is
what this whole thing was about?

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,700
You've made no attempt to even put the Sun and Moon in there, and physically explain anything.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
You just say words relating to electromagnetism, and hand wave it away.

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,660
[Globebusters] No, Dave, we're not trying
to claim that it's all caused by magnetism.

101
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,840
My God, you extrapolate stuff, that is just utterly ridiculous. We never said that.

102
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,180
[jump-cut]
And they are electromagnetic, um, phenomenon,

103
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,540
like we have been claiming for a long time.

104
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,340
Electromagnetic (x3)
...like we have been claiming for a long time.

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,020
[Dave] And another thing here, guys: even if we grant you this magnetic magic, that you're looking for,

106
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,080
it's still inconsistent with your model. Here's why.

107
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,640
[Globebusters] The line going through the middle of the screen,

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,080
if you picture the Sun traveling from
the right side of the screen to the left,

109
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,480
uh, it would create those same wind patterns above and below it.

110
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,740
[Dave] Sorry, didn't you say that the Sun moves from tropic to tropic?

111
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,120
In that case, the boundary that divides the direction of storm rotation would also move from tropic to tropic.

112
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,160
It doesn't. Storm rotation doesn't vary by the time of year.

113
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,620
Also, why wouldn't compasses follow the Sun through the sky?

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,680
Also, why wouldn't storms speed up
during the day, while near the Sun,

115
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,900
and slow down at night, when the Sun is away?

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,440
Also, if you're claiming these southern winds are so incredibly fast,

117
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,140
how is that possible, if they're the furthest away from the source of the effect?

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,220
None of it makes sense.

119
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,880
In actuality, the Coriolis effect is just the result
of basic physics relating to rotating bodies.

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,040
That's why the equator is the dividing line.
Pretty simple, don't you think?

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,680
[Globebusters] Which makes a whole lot more sense than the Coriolis effect, you know, being uh...

122
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,920
...the reason in the heliocentric on the ball Earth
for storms going in opposite sides of the equator.

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,740
In fact, that is just silly when you think about that.

124
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,800
That makes no sense whatsoever, it's ridiculous.

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,700
[Dave] Wow, very convincing counter-argument! Let's move on.

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,540
[Globebusters] Astronomy, and astrophysics, and all of that – this, Dave...

127
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,780
These aren't even real sciences, okay?

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,560
Now, you obviously are going to claim that they are.

129
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,620
But the reason that they're not real sciences, is because the only thing that you can do is observe them.

130
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,200
You cannot test them, you cannot do
anything to be interactive with them,

131
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,660
you cannot generate hypotheses,
or experiments, or anything like that.

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,700
Um, all you can do is simply observe.

133
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,640
[Dave] Sorry guys, that's dead wrong!

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,760
There are hundreds of examples I could choose, but I'll use this one.

135
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,980
In the 19th century, we noticed
irregularities in the orbit of Uranus.

136
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,960
We realized these irregularities could be explained,

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,680
if there was another planet perturbing its orbit by gravitational influence.

138
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,440
We did some math, and predicted that there
should be another planet in a particular place.

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,380
We looked in that place,
and what do you know, there it was.

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,700
You can't get any more empirical than that!

141
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,780
Do some math, make a prediction,
the prediction is verified.

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,420
The discovery of Neptune is a great example
that corroborates Newtonian gravitational theory,

143
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,620
and demonstrates that astronomy is
an empirical science, just like any other.

144
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,680
It's not surprising, that you don't understand this,
because this is one of many instances

145
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,100
that you demonstrate yourselves to be
exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

146
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,000
This is where your absolutely minimal experience has lured you into believing,

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,020
that you have expertise in a particular field,
where in reality you are essentially incompetent.

148
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,220
It is a cognitive bias, that will be demonstrated many more times in this video.

149
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,060
Now let's move on to another category.

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,700
There are about a thousand Flat Earth gotchas,

151
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,280
that all amount to an inability to understand conservation of momentum.

152
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,120
These are your helicopters and planes arguments.
Let's see which ones you're guilty of.

153
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,920
[Globebusters] Yeah, absolutely. Like,
if you're doing an Olympic, say, long jump event,

154
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,940
I would always opt to jump from east to west,

155
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,660
because, you know, where you're going to land
should be racing towards you.

156
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,260
[Dave] No. When you jump off the Earth,
or take off from the Earth,

157
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,080
you retain the momentum imparted upon you by the rotation of the Earth.

158
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,540
This has nothing to do with the atmosphere. It's also very easy to prove.

159
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,640
Stand on the back of a moving truck. Jump up.

160
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,020
What happens? Do you fly back off the truck at 30 miles an hour?

161
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,680
No, you land right back where you started,

162
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,080
even though the truck has moved forward while you were in the air.

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,940
Why? Because in the air, you retain
the forward momentum of the truck.

164
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,000
When you jump off the Earth, or take off
from the Earth, the same thing applies.

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,560
[Globebusters] And of course the globe-earthers are gonna say,

166
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,340
while you have your momentum that's lent to you by the Earth,

167
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,540
that's, you know, spinning east, and you're going to retain that momentum, uh, forever;

168
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,700
and the same thing applies to airline flights.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,460
[Dave] Yeah, you got it!
So are we good here?

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,120
[Globebusters] But if you do a test on a train,
or like you said, on a plane,

171
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,060
and just simply jog from the front of a moving train to the rear,

172
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,100
and maybe time yourself, or just observe, you know.

173
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,900
And then do the same thing running or jogging to the front of the moving train.

174
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,140
I've done this myself – I promise you that you'll find,

175
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,380
that it is much easier to run from
the front of the train to the rear.

176
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
[Dave] That's your test? Pretty tough
to reproduce, don't you think?

177
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Here's an idea: what if it was harder to jog to the front of the train, because the train was speeding up slightly?

178
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,420
Try it again, when the train is slowing down.
I bet your results will change.

179
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Sorry, this is not a valid experiment.

180
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,500
[Globebusters] 25-mile target from
New Jersey has a flight time of 90 seconds.

181
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,440
So you're aiming 90 degrees from the ship,
straight to the equator, to hit that lighthouse.

182
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
And it takes 90 seconds for the bullet to get there.

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,500
Problem is, in 90 seconds at the equator the Earth moves 25 miles.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,740
So it takes 90 seconds for the bullet
to get from the ship to the lighthouse,

185
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,780
but in that 90 seconds, the lighthouse moves 25 miles.

186
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,600
So you're gonna miss it by... 25 miles.

187
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,540
[Dave's voice-over]
Here's the funny part:

188
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,500
You so thoroughly don't understand conservation of momentum,

189
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,900
that when you presented this whole bit to me,

190
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,000
it was supposed to have something to do with the Coriolis effect.

191
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,520
But like I said, this basic fact of physics
has nothing to do with the atmosphere.

192
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,920
The boat and the bullet and lighthouse
are all moving around the Earth together,

193
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,660
and the bullet will continue with the same momentum that the boat has, once it leaves the gun.

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,320
Again, super easy to prove.

195
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,300
Get back on that moving truck.

196
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
This time bring a friend, and pass a ball back and forth.

197
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,500
You will observe, that the ball does not fly off the back of the truck, when it leaves your hands.

198
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,480
Instead, you will be passing it precisely as you would expect, if you were just standing on the ground.

199
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,860
Another way of expressing this,
is that you two, and the ball, and the truck,

200
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,480
constitute an inertial reference frame.

201
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,160
This is another thing that you guys have a really hard time with, so let's go through that too.

202
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,540
[Globebusters] Here is a much more accurate
depiction in the heliocentric model

203
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,440
of what our solar system is actually doing.

204
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,940
Now, where is Kepler's laws in this particular model, Dave?

205
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,920
[stutter]

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,900
The mathematics for this are not being taken into account.

207
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,680
[Dave's voice-over] This graphic is stupid.

208
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,740
The blue trails don't exist or mean anything,
and the solar system is not a vortex.

209
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,720
All the motion happens within a plane,
and we see that plane in the sky.

210
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
It's called the ecliptic, where all the planets live.

211
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,240
But more importantly, what you're trying to imply is that because the solar system is moving through the galaxy,

212
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,440
this should change all the laws of physics.
It doesn't, here's why.

213
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Let's do another experiment: drop a ball,
and see how long it takes to hit the ground.

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,760
Now let's get back on that truck, move at a constant
velocity relative to the ground, and do it again.

215
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,800
We get the same thing.
Now get on a plane, and do it again.

216
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,960
The plane is moving much faster,
but you still get the same result.

217
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,620
Each of these is an inertial reference frame.

218
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,600
The laws of physics are exactly the same
in every inertial reference frame.

219
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,820
So the results of this experiment are
the same in each of these frames,

220
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,340
no matter what speed it is moving
relative to something else.

221
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,760
That's because all motion is relative to something else.

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,240
So, I'm sorry, It doesn't matter how fast the solar system is moving relative to the center of the Milky Way,

223
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,180
or how fast the Milky Way is moving
relative to some other galaxy.

224
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,880
There is no absolute motion.
There is only relative motion.

225
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,920
And these big numbers, that you're throwing out
for shock value, are irrelevant to what you're saying.

226
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,400
We can treat the solar system as an inertial
reference frame, and the physics works just fine.

227
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,940
[Globebusters]
"Learn about inertial reference frames."
I knew you were gonna say that!

228
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,300
[smug laughter]

229
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,320
Oh yeah, we're gonna show you all about
inertial reference frames, Dave!

230
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,700
[Dave] Will you, though?

231
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,300
[Globebusters]
Inertial reference frames aren't gonna cut it.

232
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,580
These are absolute motions, that they're telling us that they're going.
(what? going where? what does that even mean?)

233
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,520
[Dave]
I told you: there's no such thing as absolute motion.

234
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,640
[Globebusters] Yeah, "there's no such things absolute motion." I love this, this is so great.

235
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,340
[Dave]
Yeah, there isn't! I'm sorry If you don't
understand that, it's not my problem.

236
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,700
[Globebusters] If science is telling us,
that we're going at all these velocities,

237
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,400
then... (smirk) then, you know,
you're telling science that it's not true.

238

[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

239
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,580
[Dave] Okay, let's shift gears and come back down to Earth.

240
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,160
You guys have a lot to say here, especially
regarding the stars in the night sky.

241
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,900
[Globebusters] Because the stars have never changed in all of recorded history,

242
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,980
all of millennia, nothing has ever changed.

243
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,380
[Dave] False – take the North Star.
Right now it's Polaris.

244
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,720
In the time of the ancient Egyptians it was another star, called Thuban, which is documented.

245
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,840
In a few thousand years, it'll be a different one still.

246
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,180
The procession is extremely slow. Any thoughts?

247
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,400
[Globebusters] So, over 18 years we should have seen a misalignment

248
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,280
between our axis of rotation, allegedly, and Polaris.

249
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,200
[Dave] Yeah, you can, just not with the naked eye. The change is very tiny.

250
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,300
[Globebusters] Now, the globe Earth proponents say there used to be a different North Star 6000 years ago.

251
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,480
And there will be another, new North Star in another 6000 years.

252
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,700
But that's just kicking the can out so far,
that nobody can observe it in the future.

253
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,360
I mean, we're all gonna be long gone in 6000 years...

254
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,520
[Dave] I'm sorry, that astronomical phenomena don't conform to your lifespan.

255
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,740
It doesn't make them fake.

256
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,860
Also, if this was all made up, why make up this part?

257
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,140
Why deliberately introduce the problem
of the procession of the rotational axis,

258
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,460
if it's not needed for anything? It makes no sense.

259
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,440
Then comes this bit about the "personal dome".

260
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,860
[Globebusters]
...at all the stars we can see. And the Stars lower to our,

261
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,460
to the horizon at the edge of that circle,
of a 12,000 (Units Please?) (sic!) diameter circle.

262
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,560
So as you move, this dome of stars
moves with you, or your dome of vision.

263
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,500
[Dave] We could deconstruct the absurdity of
this idea for 10 hours, but I'll just say one thing.

264
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,600
You can use the words "perspective"
and "refraction" all you want,

265
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,260
but that's all conjecture, unless you can build a physical model,

266
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,260
that predicts the position in the sky of any star,
for any person, anywhere in the world.

267
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,040
Do that, and then we'll talk.

268
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,380
Staying on the Earth, let's check out this
bizarre tangent you took into ecology.

269
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:15,360
[excerpt from Nutbusters' video]
At 65° N latitude, Iceland thrives with 870 native plant species and abundant animal life.

270
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:23,240
Compare this to Georgia Island, which despite being a whole 11° closer to the equator than Iceland,

271
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,440
at 54° S latitude, is nearly devoid of any eco-culture,

272
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:36,720
having only a measly 18 native plant species, and virtually no animal life.

273
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,680
[Dave] "There are no animals on this one island,
therefore, the Earth is flat." Got it.

274
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,560
Sorry guys, there's a lot more to ecology and climate than just latitude. Again, easy to prove.

275
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,280
What's the hottest place on Earth?
Death Valley, California.

276
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,960
Notice, that it is nowhere near the equator.

277
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Take a look at the distribution of biomes around the world.

278
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,900
There is some correlation with latitude, but it's not perfect.

279
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,820
Pick a latitude, and see a desert over here,
a rainforest over there, and all sorts of things.

280
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,520
And finally, the thing with the animals is just stupid.

281
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,500
The distribution of animal species is subject to an incredible set of variables, that are irrelevant to this discussion.

282
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,020
[Globebusters] So you're saying, "what does animals and poles have to do with it", Dave?

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,440
But here's your ignorance shining through, buddy.

308
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,040
[Dave] Oh, I'm so sorry! Okay, the combined
military of many nations is guarding it.

309
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
Except we can't see any military personnel,

310
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,800
or any military ships, or any military buildings,

311
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,700
or any evidence for that whatsoever. Got it!

312
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,060
And also, we can't sail anywhere near there?

313
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,040
[Globebusters] Uh, you will find out why people are not allowed down there. It's because the Antarctic Treaty.

314
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,520
[Dave] Okay, so what's that? Let's take a look.

315
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,860
So, these are the countries, that you say have their military there.

316
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,680
Now, what does it say? "No military bases", got it.

317
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,160
"No nuclear bombs", got it.

318
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,100
I don't know, looks pretty riveting,
but I don't see anything

319
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,820
about getting shot down on sight,
if you approach it in a boat.

320
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,660
Even if you insist, that no one is allowed below a certain parallel,

321
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,440
what's stopping you from getting in a ship,
and sailing around the world directly on that parallel?

322
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,640
Time it, and compare it to what a round Earth expects.
That sounds like a pretty good experiment.

323
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,620
Let's move on to gravity.
This one's a big problem for you guys.

324
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,460
Because if the Earth isn't round,
then gravity doesn't make any sense.

325
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,720
And there's no reason for objects to fall towards the ground. Let's see what you've come up with.

326
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,800
[Globebusters] You know, "what goes up must come down" is absolutely a thing here in reality.

327
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,300
Nobody's arguing that. (are u sure?)

328
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,640
But as you said, the cause of that on the
"spinning ball Earth theory" (dear God...)

329
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,360
is the mass of the Earth, warping physical space and non-physical time... (Spacetime get it right)

330
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
[Dave cuts in]
Spacetime, one thing.

331
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,480
[Globebusters]
...so, I'm really not sure how you can bend a time,

332
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,060
but maybe that's just 'cause I'm a stupid flat-earther.

Um, but here's the thing, umm...

335
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,567
First of all, you can't demonstrate in reality, that mass attracts mass.

336
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:46,260
There's no sort of experiment,
or data, or test that you can do...

337
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,080
[Dave] False. This was done with the Cavendish experiment

338
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,740
all the way back in the 18th century,
long before "NASA & Pals".

339
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,780

oh goodness, what was his name?

The, the stupid "balls in the shed experiment",

341
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,180
– whatever, yeah.
– Cavendish, Cavendish.

342
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,580
Cavendish experiment, certainly notwithstanding.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,180
But there's no evidence to suggest,
that mass attracts mass.

344
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,220
[Dave] Uh, all you did was name the experiment,

345
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,460
that does the thing you're asking for,
and then proceed to say nothing about it!

346
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,400
Physics undergrads do this experiment
all over the world, all the time.

347
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,060
If you think it's invalid, explain why.

348
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,880
[Globebusters] But of course,
 professor Dave will come back and say:

349
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,040
"Oh, it's done every day in colleges everywhere!"

350
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,200
Um, yeah, okay, whatever.

351
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,400
Um, and it certainly is not done the way that Cavendish did it.

352
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,240
[Dave] Looks pretty similar to me!

353
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,220
Also, why should it matter?

Your mantra is "Do your own research".

355

You seem to think, that science students are just told what to believe.

356
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,980
Shouldn't you be encouraging them to do
these classic experiments for themselves,

357
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,400
so that they can verify... what was it again?

358
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,200
[Globebuster #3] Um, do you guys know, what the the idea behind Cavendish was, right?

359
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,680
To measure the mass...
...mass of the Earth.

360
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,520
[Dave] Wrong. The purpose of the Cavendish experiment was to calculate the gravitational constant, G.

361
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,900
We knew these two masses, and the distance between them.

362
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,860
So measuring the force of attraction allowed us to calculate G.

363
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,700
Once we knew G, we were then able
to calculate the mass of the Earth,

364
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,960
but that's just an application of this knowledge.

365
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,000

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,620

[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

368
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,420
[Dave] So really all we have here,
is you guys talking incorrectly

369
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,280
about an experiment, and then offering no basis whatsoever for why you think it's invalid.

370
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,780
Let's see what other problems you have with gravity.

371
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,720
[Globebusters] And... if the Earth,
if you assume that the Earth is a spinning ball,

372
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,000
what you would expect, is that objects that are on the surface of this spinning ball

373
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,340
would be... would tend to be propelled away
from the center, due to centrifugal force.

374
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,740
And so, gravity is a necessity in the ball Earth theory to counteract that force,

375
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,480
and assure, that objects are stuck to the sides of the spinning sphere.

376
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,840
[Dave] Wow, an actual legitimate question!

377
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,280
Yes, there is a centrifugal force due to Earth's rotation. It's quite easy to calculate.

378
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,700
Let's look at this force at the equator, where it's greatest.

379
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,300
In general F = ma, and for this force F = mv² / r.

380
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,120
So let's solve for this acceleration term,
plugging in velocity and the radius of the Earth.

381
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,180
And that's the value.

382
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,580
As you can see, acceleration due to gravity is much bigger, so we don't have to worry about flying away.

383
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,920
But anyway, attacking gravity isn't going to help you much,

384
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,000
because you still need to explain,
why things fall down in your model.

385
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,700
Most flat-earthers cite terms like "density" and "buoyancy",

386
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,880
which is beyond ignorant, since those are really just saying gravity again.

387
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,780
Denser objects experience a stronger gravitational attraction.

388
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,900
If you take away gravity, there is nothing
about density that is relevant to this issue.

389
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,000
It remains, that any downward acceleration will require a downward force.

390
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,060
You seem to realize at least this,
so which force did you settle on?

391
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,560
[Globebusters]
You know, correct me if I'm wrong,
Bob, but this is what I believe.

392
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,500
This is a bit of conjecture,
but it makes a lot of sense to me;

393
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,040
that in order for density and buoyancy to dictate,
what is gonna go up and what is going to go down,

394
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,520
you do have to have a tendency for higher density objects to fall,

395
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,700
and relatively high... lower density objects,
liquids and gases, to rise.

396
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,380
And... it really does seem feasible, that downward tendency of higher density objects

397
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,720
is the static electric charge of the Earth.

398
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,300
Um, that is measurable, there's no theory behind that.

399
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,880
I think it's 100... what it's, 100 V per meter
of altitude, of static electric charge.

400
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:50,120
And so, there is definitely a feasible explanation for
"what goes up, must come down" on flat Earth.

when you can't account for something.

We need math. We need predictions.
We need demonstrations.

407
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,320
Materials can be paramagnetic,
or diamagnetic, or ferromagnetic.

408
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,600
Shouldn't these interact with this force
differently, and fall at different rates?

409
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,660
What about neutral particles versus charged particles?

410
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,000
What about the value of the acceleration
we observe for falling bodies, 9.8 m/s²?

411
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,100
Isn't there some math you can do to derive that?

412
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,960
Isn't there anything you can do,
to demonstrate the validity of this...

Let's see where you take this.

[Brainbusters] ...which did a piece on spider ballooning, and proving,

417
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,020
that spider ballooning does not take place
by air currents blowing the silk around;

418
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,760
but rather, the spider is able to change the electrostatic bias

419
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:02,140
of the silk strand that they are casting, and then are essentially acting as an anti-gravitational device.

therefore, gravity is electromagnetism." Got it.

going to cut it. What else you got?

so let's freeze it and take a look.

Ooh, little dipoles!
Well, being chemistry inclined,

424
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,200
this looks to me just like the intermolecular force known as dispersion.

425
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,000
This is already well understood, and does occur between all atoms and molecules, and it is attractive.

426
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
But sorry, this can't explain gravity.

427
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,880
If these are attractive interactions between these particles,

428
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,640
this arrow on the left pointing down can just as well point up, and this graphic is meaningless.

429
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,000
Gravity is the only way to explain the motion
we see on Earth. But of course, you say...

430
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:53,020
[Blockbusters] But again, it's all... horse manure, because gravity is neither caused by mass attracting mass,

431
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,180
nor is it caused by space and time bending into pockets, and then having things fall into it.

432
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,420
[Dave] Yes, gravity is both of those things.
All mass warps spacetime.

433
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,860
Therefore, all mass attracts all other mass.

If you can't understand that, that's not my problem.

Now, you say you don't believe this, and that's fine.

If you can't get that through a force pulling things down,

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,420
You know, somebody standing on the Sun
would see the Earth going around it,

461
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,600
and somebody's standing on the Earth
would see the Sun going around it.

462
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,660
[Dave cuts in]
Uh... yeah??

463
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,140
[Globebusters]
"That's the sound of science at play."

464
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,540
No, that's the sound of a man with a worldview,

465
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,140
who is refusing to go by observations,
and instead would rather make something up.

466
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,140
Like the expanding universe, that exploded from nothing at the Big Bang,

467
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,840
and continues to fly out at crazy speeds,
you know, past the speed of light, uh... just insane.

468
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,440
[Dave] Yeah, sounds pretty zany.
But the Big Bang cosmological model

469
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,440
is very well substantiated by empirical evidence.

470
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,980
Recession velocities of galaxies suggest
a particular age for the universe,

471
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,940
and the detection of the cosmic microwave background radiation,

472
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,400
that originated during the recombination era, corroborates that age.

473
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,380
[Globebusters]
Yeah. And let's not forget

474
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,540
that even in modern day experiments that have been recently done, in the last decade,

475
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,180
like the cosmic microwave background
experiment, and measurements, right?

476
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,060
What did it find? It found, that the Earth was at the center

477
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,340
of all of that cosmic microwave background!
[fake gasp] Oh no, right?

478
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,880
[Dave] Wow, no. This radiation, detected in the 60s,

479
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,300
is of extreme isotropy – meaning that looks the same everywhere.

480
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,100
And it has absolutely nothing to do
with what you're talking about, at all.

481
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,620
Google it and see, but I think you know that.

482
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,980
I think you're borrowing the term to make an unrelated claim,

483
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,460
and are hoping that your viewers won't look into it.

484
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,040
[Globebusters]
There are no direct measurements
of dark matter, for crying out loud!

485
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,700
In fact, mainstream physics right now at this point
has all but completely debunked it!

486
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,520
So you are so far behind the curve, Dave.

487
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,840
You don't even know what the hell you're talking about, dude.

488
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
I mean, oh my God! Uh, so...

489
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, they're basically looking there and saying
"Oh, there's a bunch of stuff missing here."

490
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,200
And then he's saying, that that is direct evidence?

491
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,320
[Dave] No, guys! Astronomers don't just say
"There's stuff missing here, therefore dark matter."

492
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,500
You may think that, because you read a blog post
that oversimplifies the concept for a layperson;

493
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,180
and you've convinced yourself, that you
understand it better than scientists.

494
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,380
But in actuality, the people that know dark matter is there

495
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,460
and are trying to figure out what it is,
write papers that look like this.

496
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,460
Since you have zero formal training in astrophysics,

497
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,140
if this looks too complicated for you to understand, that's not my problem.

498
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,340
[Globebusters]
You can't even demonstrate a gravitational wave,

499
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,040
other than if you wanna take Neil deGrasse Tyson

500
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,740
going onstage and dropping a microphone, and calling that gravity.

[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

502
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,400
And you can sit here and say we don't understand this, uh, Dave,

503
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,320
but you would be quite wrong, uh,
because we have lectured on this many times,

504
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,280
about exactly how it does work,
and how it is quite impossible.

505
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,720
[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

506
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,940
Then you have Einstein's model of gravity, which of course is, theoretically, the bending of space AND time.

507
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,000
[deadpan silence, which should speak for itself]

508
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,720
[*scoffs*]

509
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,020
[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

510
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,420
Again: something that is not demonstrable,
is only theoretical, is only mathematical.

511
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,900
You have no proof of it whatsoever.
And it is just stupid, okay?

512
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,020
It makes no sense, and it's a big lie.

513
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,140
And I'm sorry, but you're never gonna be able
to prove it, because there is no proof for it,

514
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,540
no matter what's your mathematical equations say, Dave, okay?

515
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,900
[Dave] Sorry, general relativity is one of the most
corroborated theories in the history of science.

516
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,100
The model predicts the perihelion precession
of Mercury with extreme precision.

517
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,740
We can see gravitational lensing all over the universe, with magnitudes,

518
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,760
that align with the cumulative masses the light is bending around.

519
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,520
Relativistic time delay in radar signal travel time near the Sun.

520
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,620
But once again: if you don't understand
any of that, that's not my problem.

521
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,640
So, that's the bulk of it. But let's quickly hit
some of your miscellaneous points.

522
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,060
[Globebusters]
People talk about the Santiago to Sydney, uh, flights.

523
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,520
Well, you... if you go into them with uh, understanding,

524
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,540
that there are winds aloft, and these patterns are travelling...

525
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,680
These wind currents are traveling in these patterns,
especially towards the southern edge,

526
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,340
um, and their velocities are extremely high,

527
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:39,260
that go up to, you know, 199 km/h,
or um, you know, 136 km/h.

528
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,200
And you add these, uh, velocities onto the aircraft, uh...

529
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,680
...flight speed, which gives you a higher ground speed;

530
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,560
then all of a sudden, these distances are not so impossible to believe,

531
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,800
and they make a lot more sense on the flat Earth.

532
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
[Dave] This thing with the flights.

533
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,120
You used to say there were no direct
flights in the southern hemisphere,

534
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,480
now you're admitting there are.

535
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,320
So because they have to go so far on your model,

536
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,100
you explain it with these 200 km/h winds,
which is hurricane speeds.

537
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,340
Also, just find the flights online!
Here are several I found in about 30 seconds.

538
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,440
They go one way, and then return the other
direction in pretty close to the same time.

539
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,680
So, I just don't know what you're talking about here.
The flights are consistent with a round Earth.

540
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,540
[Globebusters]
Or the, you know, the whole nonsense about Aristophanes measuring that the Earth was a sphere.

541
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,340
And knew its exact size and stuff, in 275 BC.

542
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,760
But it then took 1,800 years, until somebody's
got in a boat and said "let's go west".

543
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,720
– That's ridiculous.
– Right!

544
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,220
[Dave] Uh, totally irrelevant. Sailing across oceans was very treacherous back then.

545
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
The statement is also patently false!

546
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,260
Vikings were going west hundreds of years
before the other European explorers.

547
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,240
[Globebusters] The only thing that is obvious,
is the Earth is obviously and obserbably flat.

548
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,580
You look out, you never see any curve,
you see flat, desn't matter how high you go.

549
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,580
If you send a balloon all the way up
to 120,000 feet, there is no curvature.

550
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,140
[Dave] Right, except for that if you take the original source for the video footage you guys show,

551
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,420
and skip around a little, we can see that
a lens effect is causing the horizon

552
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,920
to literally invert, depending on where it is in the frame.

553
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,120
It can look flat, it can even become concave!
And it certainly can look round.

554
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,160
So when you only show the flat part,
what do we call that?

555
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,400
[no comment needed]

556
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,580
[Globebusters] Now we know, that there is "bendy light".

557
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,820
And it's not just the atmosphere,
the Earth has a magnetic field.

558
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,680
Magnetic fields can indeed perturb
and bend the path of light.

559
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,520
[Dave] No, it can't! Try and demonstrate it.

560
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,220
[Globebusters]
Which is not Earth rotation, Dave.
In fact, it's it's quite easy to prove

561
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,800
that It's the Energy of the Heavens
and of the ether, the luminaterous (?) ether.

562
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,200
[Dave] "Energy of the Heavens"? That's the most
pseudo-scientific term I've ever heard.

563
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,360
[Globebusters] The entire periodic table is quantum calculations.

564
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,240
And it works! We use it to do chemistry.

565
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,320
You have no clue what you're talking about!

566
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,060
[jump-cut]
The periodic table is not mathematics.

567
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,820
But you have to go off and sound like you're some sort of smartypants,

568
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,780
by using big words like "quantum calculations".

569
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,780
[Dave] I'm sure that to you, "quantum calculations" sound like vewy big words.

570
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,440
But to grown up, real chemists,
they're real things that are done every day.

571
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,480
And I'm sorry, I do know what I'm talking about.

572
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,540
I studied chemistry. I've done chemistry. I taught chemistry.

573
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,900
Aand because of that, I understand that quantum mechanical calculations

574
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,460
allowed us to discern the shapes and relative energies of atomic orbitals

575
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,600
that electrons inhabit within an atom.

576
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,460
These electron configurations are what give elements their properties.

577
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,360
And, it is what is responsible for the periodicity,
that makes the periodic table what it is.

578
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,700
This fundamental understanding allows us to
predict the properties of certain compounds,

579
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,700
and therefore build new materials, that are inside your computer and your smartphone that you use everyday.

580
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:04,140
These calculations also predict things like spectral lines,
which connects chemistry beautifully to astronomy.

581
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,120
Because it allows us to look at the light from an object, and know what it's made of.

582
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,700
That's how we know the Sun and the stars are made of the same stuff.

583
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,740
But once again, if you don't understand that, it's not my problem.

584
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,100
[Globebusters]
Well, he's doing what he was told to do, right?

585
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,400
Yeah, yeah...

586
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,640
Doing what he's told to do, which is to read the, you know, the curriculum,

587
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,960
the lesson plan, the... you know,
the educational programming.

588
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,420
[Dave] No, guys! Myself and other teachers
of undergraduate and graduate-level material

589
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,200
make our own curricula. When I taught,
I taught what I pleased.

590
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,780
[Globebusters]
We were all indoctrinated by the same
educational curriculum, the same system.

591
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,960
[Dave] Also not true!

592
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,140
Every country has its own educational
system, and some are better than others.

593
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,720
In America we have public and private institutions,
the latter of which are not federally funded.

594
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,140
The idea, that everyone is getting the exact same education,

595
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,600
especially the brainwashy one that you're implying, is just not true.

596
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,240
Furthermore, science is not doctrine
as much as you pretend it is.

597
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,520
Even as early as high school, students do
experiments to determine how things work.

598
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,340
They take a stopwatch and a pendulum,
or a ramp, or whatever rudimentary apparatus,

599
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,820
they take some measurements, and they personally
derive the equations that science already knows.

600
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Students are not handed their worldview like a Bible.

601
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,700
They actively create it as they go through
undergraduate and graduate programs,

602
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,140
doing empirical science, making predictions, thinking critically,

603
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,500
and innovating all the new technology,
that even you get to enjoy.

604
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,420
If you had studied science in a formal setting, you'd know that.

605
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,340
And finally, let's touch on the conspiracy factor.

606
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,980
Seems like a lot of people would have to be in on this, no?

607
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,660
[Globebusters] I don't even think that the majority of people who work at NASA, are in on it.

608
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,280
You know, the guys that are designing satellites,
and designing the Rovers and stuff.

609
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,500
I'm very confident that they believe what
they're inventing is going up into space.

610
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,400
But um... that's, that's it! They... 
You know, that's plausible deniability.

611
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,080
[Dave] And then what? What happens every day,

612
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,940
as people carry out their fake missions,
and receive full salary?

613
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,120
Do thousands of people just sit in an empty room and stare at the wall,

614
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,820
like George Costanza and the Pensky file?

615
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,100
It's not just NASA. All scientists!

616
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,320
If literally all of physics is wrong,
what do physicists do??

617
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,880
Or geologists? Do they just hide under
a pile of coats everyday for 50 years?

618
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,600
Who pays for that?
We could go all day.

619
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,080
And the Globebusters, like all prominent flat-earthers, have an endless list of talking points.

620
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,920
But that endless list is nothing more
than a distraction from one simple fact.

621
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,980
There is no Flat Earth model.

622
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,900
You have no unifying model to point to.

623
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,660
Let's quickly review why.

624
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,280
[Dave from the previous video]
How does light reach half the plane,
and not the other half?

625
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,920
[laughs it off]

626
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,080
[Dave] Pretty funny, huh?
Wanna try and answer the question?

627
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,780
[Globebusters]
Clearly, refraction comes into play here as well.

628
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,280
So, the sunlight is not going to uh,
shine forever in all directions.

629
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,220
When it, you know, when it hits the atmosphere,

630
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,740
it's going to be bent or perturbed in varying directions.

631
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,760
But that's a very, very simple one to answer.

632
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,220
[Dave] If it's so simple to answer,
where's the illustration? I bet I know.

633
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,000
[Globebusters] And it's a... close Sun, and uh, yeah,

634
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,940
so it allows it to keep its light
on only about half the plane at a time.

635
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,660
[Dave]
What was that? "Only about half the plane"?

636
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,640
"On only about half the plane at a time."

637
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,240
No, guys, it must be exactly half the plane.

638
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,860
Because exactly half the world is day
and half is night at any given time.

639
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,000
I'll give you one more chance to do anything
beyond just listing random terminology.

640
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,920
[Guy #1] "Come up with a mechanism for why light dissipates appropriately"? What?

641
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,480
[Guy #2] The atmosphere, the air, everything around us.

642
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
[Guy #1] The atmosphere, the air,
the inverse square law, you know.

643
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,520
Light dissipates, you know, by that alone. It's like...

644
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,660
This, this guy is... so lost.

645
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,080
We don't need to come up with anything,
that's already been come up with.

646
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,580
[Dave] It's pretty obvious why you just
say a few words and giggle to yourself.

647
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,860
Because there is no way you're going to explain this line with the inverse square law,

648
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,440
and I would 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚 to see you try.

649
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,360
Sorry, but this model works much better.

650
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,080
[Dave from the previous video]
As Earth rotates, it's daytime when facing the Sun,

651
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,280
and nighttime when facing away from the Sun.

652
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,100
[Flathead] No...
[Dave] Yeah!

653
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,280
And what was your complaint about the seasons again?

654
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,400
[Flathead] Uh, you know, we've got nearly 400 Earth diameters,

655
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,140
that we are closer to the Sun, at least in the northern hemisphere, in the wintertime.

656
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,680
[Dave] What you're saying is irrelevant,
and you know it's irrelevant.

657
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,380
That's why you specified "northern hemisphere",
in order to sound so confused.

658
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,360
Because you know that in the southern hemisphere
in July it's cold, and in January It's warm,

659
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,640
which correlates with the change in distance that you're citing.

660
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,660
So you know that distance can't have anything to do with it.

661
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,040
But you say it anyway.

662
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,840
And what was your model for the seasons again?

663
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,140
Well, this still doesn't work, because the seasons are all the same length,

664
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,100
and the Sun always travels through the sky the same speed.

665
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,760
But once again, a much bigger problem is that you don't even try to put these two models together!

666
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,460
You don't show the path of the Sun changing on this one, like you say it's supposed to.

667
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,900
And you don't show the Sun illuminating precisely half the Earth on this one, like you know it's supposed to!

668
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,180
You just can't put these two together.
And because you can't do that,

669
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,400
there is no such thing as the Flat Earth model,
which is kind of a huge problem for you.

670
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,140
Now, you know very well that I called you out
on this before. What was your response?

671
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,360
[Dave from the previous video]
"The sheer fact, that each phenomenon

672
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,440
requires its own independent explanation makes it unscientific."

673
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,300
[Flathead 1: *scoffs*]
[Flathead 2: What?]
"If we invent a luminous, Sun-like object..."

674
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,120
[current Dave]
Some food for thought.

675
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,200
Before we wrap up, let's see what you had to say about medicine.

676
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,260
[Globebusters] Of course, you've got these Western medicine that just

677
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,820
basically masks symptoms, or covers up your symptoms, so...

678
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,580
There is so much evidence at this point,

679
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,400
that shows that vaccines are extremely harmful.

680
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,580
Uh, they have been proven unequivocally and linked to autism.

681
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,300
So, if you think that's okay, to just send your children to these doctors

682
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,980
and let them poke them, you know... I don't know how many shots kids get nowadays.

683
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,400
It's like 70 or something, ridiculous.
Uh, it's pretty... pretty scary.

684
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:50,560
[♫ Kevin MacLeod, "Local Forecast - Elevator" ♫]

685
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,580
[Dave] This is really how I justify having gotten involved in this at all.

686
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,020
If someone wants to believe the Earth is flat, I don't care.

687
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,640
But as you have demonstrated, conspiratorial thinking

688
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,840
makes people susceptible to other conspiracy theories.

689
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,300
Like the anti-vaccine movement,
which is a public health risk.

690
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,340
It endangers other people.

691
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,840
But that's a debate for another time.

692
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,580
So... that's it. To my regular viewers,
I hope you got a kick out of this.

693
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,660
To any flat-earthers watching:
if you seek the truth as you claim,

694
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,900
you need a coherent model.

695
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,200
A single, physical working model, that explains
everything around us at the same time.

696
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,740
Because everything is happening at the same time.

697
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,120
And you need to be demanding this model
from the people you're following.

698
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,060
And finally, to the Globebusters:

699
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,260
I don't know you. I don't know what motivates you.

700
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,760
You might believe the things that you say.

701
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,100
You might be deliberately manipulating your followers to earn money and feel special.

702
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,560
I can't be sure.

703
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,520
You can respond to this video or not. I don't care.

704
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,480
I'm definitely not going to be making any more of these,

705
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,640
because I have much better things to do,

706
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,880
and I'm going to get back to doing those things now.

707
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,800
To anyone who made it to the end:
thanks for watching, take it easy.
